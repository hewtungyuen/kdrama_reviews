       "I love the story... I watched Lee Min Ho's series before, he was okey back then. but in TKEM I feel that he matured alot,you can feel the intense emotions from his eyes, facial expression and the tone of his voice.I love Kim Go Eun from Goblin she is an effective actress you can feel her pain, longing, sadness. I think their chemistry is really good. TKEM is not the usual Kdrama. It is worth it... I'll be shipping Kim Go Eun and Lee Min Ho forever they look good together.

       "I've finished the 16th episode. I don't really know what to say. Even if this drema would have huge ratings, I couldnt like it too much. But perhaps it's a bit objective that people got bored with it. I liked the ending, although for some reason couldnt get on with feeling bored. I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on. Is it the dialogues, always the way they talk like riddles. I've lost interest and sometimes couldnt get on what's going on. I'm not sure about any international success it has, but I couldnt enjoy it really much for some reason. I had to watch this, i dont feel like i wasted time. I liked some stories, some things were really emotional. But just not that good. I'd totally prefer Secret Garden over it. It was amazing. Why? I guess screenwriting, directing and all other things really matter and no matter if the story is complex, mysterious or good, without all other elements it doesnt work. I don't think I'll rewatch this.<br/>\n",

       "So, I'm not sure which fault is that. Plot is actually pretty interesting, and script too. It couldve been one of the best dramas in 2020... But there were something wrong with everything else. I'll list you all things what I believe went wrong.\n",
       "</p><p>Directing and editing:\n",
       "The drama was very slow, but the pacing is never a problem. I hate comparing, but I cannot avoid to do so with Goblin. It had slow pacing in a lot of moments, but the directing and screenwriting made it all very good, very balanced and harmonic. Same goes to something like CLOY. Soundtrack, OSTs fitted and everything worked perfectly. Fast pacing never makes a series or a drama a better thing as itself, but the directing and editing does. And this flopped here. There were so much of unnecessary things that could be avoided and fast-paced. During the episode 6, which is a pinnacle of boredom in the show, the battle with Japanese ships I cringed and laughed my ass off for all the unnecessary filling and stuff that has been happening there. I were numb when I suddenly bursted out with laughter. They tried to make this so epic with all these camera angles and epic faces of Lee Min Ho and Woo Do Hwan that I laughed so hard I nearly shat my pants. Sorry guys. Same with the scene where cops chasing suspects... in the very same time of episode. It was shown the most boring way it could've been. It didnt work. And there were a lot of these things. Sometimes my interest woke up, but then it disappeared, and then again and again.\n",
       "</p><p>Characters:\n",
       "The characters were greatly written (not all tho, I still couldnt understand necessarity of Prime Minister and all her scenes in first half of the show) but again, directing made them boring. I were trying to think why and how this show bores me. It just couldnt have made me hooked. The only moments I remember I didnt feel bored was when Eun Sup showed up on screen, when someone died or when Lee Gon went mad on killing everyone. Everything else - sometimes I really had to force myself on looking on screen. I hate to say this, but this ain't good.\n",
       "</p><p>Chemistry:\n",
       "Between main leads - I dont know. Feelings of Jeong Tae-Eul came out of nowhere really. She cries at some points and it doesnt work for her character and for me, or at least they didnt show how it should've been. And Lee Min Ho - his potential was realised only somewhere near the end of the show, but before I was bored looking at his numb face and idle poses they've been practicing a lot.\n",
       "</p><p>Storytelling:\n",
       "Its very messy. Why so many unnecessary characters, stories. At some point I've stopped understanding what's going on and had to rethink how certain things are affecting anyone in the series. Oh and there were little accents on moments where there should have been. It was messy as I said earlier. I couldnt remember a lot of names because of that, and lost my interest almost to everyone except main characters (because I was interested what's gonna happen next; I lost my sympathy and enjoyment somewhere in first episodes). The music were just for the background, wasnt fitting in a lot of moments. Sometimes it was so epic I cringed. OSTs were very actually very good tho. When they started to play, I became a bit alive.\n",
       "</p><p>Every episode, I swear, I was trying to look at from zero, without prejudice. And guess what - I could handle to watch only first few minutes with enjoyment, but the other hour is me being bored but forcing myself to watch because I'm interested in the thing itself and hoping for better episodes.\n",
       "</p><p>The show has so much of flaws that its gonna take a while to proceed them all. Apparently, this is going to be example that good investment, characters and story can be ruined by poor directing, editing and storytelling. This is going to be example how you shouldn't make a show.\n",
       "</p><p>People shouldn't suggest that it flopped because of advertisements. If the show was good enough, it wouldnt matter, even tho there were too much of ads and it was too direct that I couldnt help but cringe. But the show itself wasnt as good. I liked it somewhere, enjoyed it a bit. It gave some goosebumps but I just felt something isnt really right. The last like 6-7 episodes were a lot better than first ones, but still sometimes it was boring. And the drama could've been very good, but it turned out this. You should try watch it for yourself, but I dont think I would do it again. I'm kind of tired of it. I'm in the middle of 15th episode and I'm sleepy.<br/>\n",

       "I loved this story. It is exceptionally well written, directed and acted. And it would have been perfect, except for the ending. I think it suffers from a problem that is endemic in modern storytelling and betrays a problem in modern thought. It seems that these days it is considered smart to get a college education and settle in a job before you get serious about relationships. To my mind, this story points out the flaw in that way of thinking. As so many stories do, it starts with two people with fully developed lives in different worlds. By that I mean they each has an education, job, family, and relationships they have strived their whole life to make for themselves. This presents a problem for a romantic story, because one of them will ultimately have to give up their world to be with the other. While this story does as brilliant a job as can be done in working with that problem, it is one that is never satisfyingly resolved even to the very last frame. Ultimately we are left feeling that each one puts more value on their job than they do on the person they are supposedly desperate to be with.<br/>\n",

       "SPOILER\n",
       "</p><p>About the scar, what a bummer. They made such a big deal out of it then I felt like they dropped the ball on it. Ok, here's some more thoughts ...\n",
       "</p><p>Yo-Yo Boy (Aka: the spirit of the Manpasikjeok)\n",
       "He is basically the gate keeper and controls access to all the parallel worlds. He has the ability to appear in any physical form (young or older) and moves between worlds at will. Whichever physical form he appears in is probably dependent on what he needs to accomplish.\n",
       "</p><p>The Yo-Yo I'm surprise no one has mentioned the yo-yo and what is its purpose. Here's my 2 cents on this topic. Basically, the yo-yo represents the parallel worlds. You always see the boy constantly moving the yo-yo. This is symbolic of him doing his basic function which is to keep the parallel worlds in perpetual motion and in balance. Think of each of the two discs of the yo-yo as parallel world opposites separated from each other by a string and Yo-Yo boy is there to ensure all worlds are in balance and working the way they should be.\n",
       "</p><p>When the Manpasikjeok was broken in half, it took some of the control of the worlds out of yo-yo boy's hands and into the hands of whoever has the Manpasikjeok pieces. Lee Lim's activities were basically causing the entire yo-yo to be out of balance. The Corea side of the yo-yo was heavy with activities. If that keeps up, the yo yo will not work right to the point where it will be noticeable. Hence the bleed throughs into both Corea/Korea such as people in both worlds experiencing flashes of their dopplegangers. Ultimately, if nothing is done to correct the imbalance, the yo-yo will actually stop working. This was already well on its way; the more the Corea citizens affect changes in Korea, the longer time freezes. Ultimately, all parallel worlds would come to a stand still at some point (AKA time freezes forever and so is life as we know it).\n",
       "</p><p>In order to restore balance, Yo-Yo boy needed a force to counter the Lee Lim force that caused the imbalance. This force, however, can not come from the Kingdom of Corea because that is where the driving force that messed things up came from - Lee Lim. The driving force to restore balance must come from the Republic of Korea to balance things out. Just imagine you and I having an arm wrestling contest. If I am winning and I'm able to pull your arm past the midpoint toward my side, the only way that balance can be restored is if you exert enough force to bring yourself back to the midpoint. Now apply this same concept to Corea/Korea with me being Corea and you being Korea.\n",
       "</p><p>A perfect example of why the Corea side can not restore the balance is in Episode 14. When both Lee Lim &amp; the King were inside the place between-zero-and-one at the same time, it made the Manpasikjeok \"whole\" again. They both had an equal chance to change events that night but things still didn't turn out the way they wanted. The 2020 Lee Lim got killed by the 1994 Lee Lim and the King didn't make much of a change to his past situation. Their efforts did not work because the driving force and catalyst to fix both worlds must come from Korea - the other half of the yo-yo.\n",
       "</p><p>Yo-Yo boy choose Tae-Eul to be that force to provide the equal and opposite reaction to put things in motion and back into balance. Why? Because she is the exact opposite of what Lee Lim stands for, she wants the worlds to be balanced AND she has the courage to pull it off. That was her fate. I think symbolically, she is the red string on the yo-yo. I googled it and this actually exists! \"The Red Thread of Fate is an East Asian belief originating from Chinese mythology. It is commonly thought of as an invisible red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are \"their true love\". ...The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. \"\n",
       "</p><p>In the last episode, the yo-yo boy &amp; teenage boy were shown as flashbacks in Tae-Eul's life to conveyed that he has been keeping an eye on Tae-Eul all along. If you need more proof of Tae-Eul's fate, rewatch the order of things in the last episode.\n",
       "</p><p>Her first successful shot went off which represented the force that was needed to get the yo yo going again and the 2 worlds back on track. You know everything is back on track because immediately right after the successful shot:\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<pre>-  The lily plant begins to grow the green shoot.  (Proof that time no longer freezes)\n",
       "</pre>\n",
       "<p>- There is now wind in the place between-zero-and-one. You can see the wind because her hair was blowing.\n",
       "- In the King's between-zero-and-one place, all the red balloons and other stuff are now moving in the air.\n",
       "- Lee Lim's body disintegrated in the between-zero-and-one place and his watch that was left was actually working and not frozen in time.\n",
       "- The events that were the result of the 2 worlds crossing disappeared. For example, Sin-Jae's pic from Tae-ul's world.\n",
       "</p><p>Note that after she fired the successful shot then the King took care of Lee Lim. (At first I thought it was weird the order of things and had to really use my brain cells to figure this one out.)\n",
       "</p><p>The Fast Romance: diehardfan explains it the best. You have to understand it could be at least 3-4 months by the time they see each other next. So while apart, they are actually not apart because they were thinking of each other and longing to be in the company of each other. This is why the next time they see each other, they keep saying, \"I missed you\", or \"Have you been waiting for me?\" It just solidifies the saying, \"Absence makes the heart grows fonder\".\n",
       "</p><p>This is really not your typical romance. If you don't know when or if you will ever see the other person again, you will probably do what they do - gladly accept your fate and live in the moment. Cause all you really are guaranteed is just that moment. I think if they put a time caption on when the King meets Tae-Eul next (ex: \"6 months later\") that would help the audience understand their time constraints better.\n",
       "</p><p>Shin-Jae Jeez, Kim Kyung-Nam is just too cool. His acting was just spot on when his mother ran out to give him a hug…. and he didn't even have to say one word. Bravo!!!\n",
       "</p><p>Overall, I don't recommend this show for just anyone. If you are a deep thinker and like to solve a good mystery then this is right up your alley. It's really a show that keeps on giving because it does require a lot of utilizing the brain cells to get the full impact of the plot. Even after rewatching things, you start to notice more clues that you didn't really notice before. I love it and hoping there will be a sequel!<br/>\n",

Couldn't they at least get married or something? Like doesn't her dad question where she's going every weekend? Idk it just wasn't satisfying. Also, where did the teen version of the yoyo kid come from??? Some things just did not make sense! :?<br/>\n",

At first it seems like out of blue they just fell in love which does not make sense. But actually everytime min ho goes back to his kingdom, it takes time for him to come back and so the time the spent together and the time they are not together somehow made them think of each other more often and made them fall in love for each other. Min ho has to travel back and forth to get to the present because he can only travel one way which at first did not make sense too. But I had to watch it again to understand.

       "I avoided this drama because everywhere I read about it people were complaining about how convoluted or boring it was. Also, I don't hate LMH but I'm always skeptical about his projects because most of the time they're fan-driven rather than story-driven. Worst of all, at the time it was airing The World Of The Married had me by the throat so I had no room for anything else. Last night, I was bored so I decided to throw away one or two hours on this drama to see why everyone hated. And thus commenced the marathon.\n",
       "</p><p>A day later, I'm done and I have to say it's not as bad as sold. I mean it's not 'Mr. Sunshine' but it's on par with Goblin. It's shine was just dulled by the fact that it was up against a power-house drama. Most of the things people found confusing were just because they were impatient. If you're a person who enjoys mysteries, you'll love seeing the unexplained twists slowly unraveling. As for the claims of lack of chemistry between the leads, it's obviously a rumor made up by people who haven't watched 'Lovely Horribly' . Lee Gon and Tae-Eul's relationship started fast but when it caught on, it was bittersweet and kept on pulling at my heartstrings.\n",
       "</p><p>I feel like everyone who had a doppelganger gave applause-deserving performances. Jo Young's loyalty was un-parelled no matter the universe. Shin-jae impressed me because he was the one who had the most to lose by doing the right thing, and yet he still did it. The P.M.... lol. Obviously, she's just bad in every single version of herself in the different words.\n",

       "People’s opinion about this drama is either they hate it or love it . I’m one of those people who found it boring around ep.6-9 but after rewatching it I was blown away how many I’ve missed and totally live it after that. This drama gave me a unique experience where it’s my first time commenting online even joining a group just to share my theories , spend hours searching different peoples theories even studied some math/ science related stuff. I might not be good drama for others but for me this is the Best Drama for me not just because the story , and actors but the experience that this drama gave me it makes me interact with the stranger just to share a theory and I feel like I made new friends because of this drama. Im not a fan of Lee min ho. I can’t even finish most of his drama as they’re just typical cliche. As for Kim Go Eun I know that she’s an excellent actress but I can say that Goblin is not for me . This drama made me a fan for both of them.I thank the writers, actors and crew for making this extraordinary drama despite the criticism and harsh bashing . I know more extra ordinary drama will come but TKEM will always be special to my Heart. Thank you for the experience . I’m crying ?<br/>\n",

       "The drama was sooo great! Some people would call me a weirdo because I prefer The King: Eternal Monarch rather than Crash Landing On You, but that's because The King had some unexpected scenes. CLOY was too obvious. And I also prefer it because it has my favorite actors, Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun. Add the writer too! I'm glad that they were apart of the drama. It's quite sad that it's finished. I can't believe that a lot of people critize this drama. Especially Lee Gon and Tae-eul's chemistry. To me, it was awesome. This will always be my favorite drama.<br/>\n",

       "Long story short, this kdrama was a roasted chicken with no seasoning. It's the kind of chicken that you consider a decent meal, but it won't leave you hanging and hoping to eat it again later, nor will you remember it.\n",
       "</p><p>While I agree with other comments that Lee Min Ho was quite emotionless in this role, the drama on its own failed to bring out any tears or feelings. Although the drama does cover the suffering of many people between the two worlds, their stories always lacked depth and ended up being undeveloped.\n",
       "</p><p>At the same time, the drama constantly clung onto safety and refused to let anyone important die. As an example (SPOILERS ahead), when both the Royal Guard Captain and his comedian counter-part from the other world got shot and were saved by their bulletproof vests, the writer missed a good opportunity to kill off the comedian counter-part and introduce the consequences of mixing fates of people from two parallel dimensions. That would have resulted in an actual tear jerker this drama needed, and a significant challenge for Lee Gon's and Tae Eul's romance.\n",
       "The only time this drama was close to a tear jerker was when Lee Gon's uncle died, however even that was too sudden and didn't have the impact it should have had, it just happened out of nowhere, but also didn't surprise me.\n",
       "</p><p>I can't help but compare it to Goblin since the drama has a similar concept and the same female lead actress... Goblin somehow succeeded in making a story that didn't have an obvious plot or ending, whereas Eternal Monarch just stuck with the recycled. Overall this kdrama does not have any re-watch value for me, the romance between the leads was pretty shallow overall.<br/>\n",

It was unfolding really well until they decided to add time travel to it and this left holes in the drama that just does't make sense no matter how you try to explain it.

       "SPOILERS! I can understand why people are complaining that this flopped after episode 13. The whole time travelling thing became a big problem and that is because it created so much loop holes in the drama. Letting them keep their memory was the biggest loop hole in the drama since it cannot correspond with the past they later created. If the past really changed then he should never have known her hence their memory should not exist. Then there is the problem with lee lim, if he was killed by his past self then the drama has ended because the bad guy is gone but since he still existed that means we followed the one that did the killing, then that would mean there are more lee gon travelling through time since he has never died. Argh! this is so twisted, they should have just made them fall in love with their respective world selves. That would have been a better ending, after all the romance was boring as there was no chemistry.<br/>\n",

Also a lot of similar things to Goblin I can't help but to think of repeating. I wish the story will turn more interesting and original in the further episodes. Lee Min Ho is great tho.<br/>\n",

       "The best drama I've seen so far. Every episode was just mind blowing. It ended just perfectly. I had mixed emotions after watching the ending. With all the twists and turns it was awesome and fantastic. I started watching it because of Lee Min Ho as I waited long for his comeback and I think I would have loved it despite the story due to his presence but over time I started to like the other actors as well especially Woo Do Hwan. I was indeed surprised by his switching of dialects and was really amazed at his portraying of entirely different characters. Even when Jo Yeong disguised as Eun Seop, we could still feel yeong in him. All the characters were well portrayed and the villain was also just amazing. This will be one of the best drama of 2020 and it really helped me keep sane during these quarantine times. Thanks to the director and cast for giving this amazing drama. One word...Daebak!<br/>\n",

       "I think this is the first drama that Lee Min Ho's female lead is younger than him. They did a good job together, as predicted. They are good actors. The idea is interesting and really good. However, I find some scenes are kinda absurd, like how LG found JTE after she was abducted. Why did he has to bring cavalry while he could easily ride cars? I suppose it made a great dramatic scene, but I think it was kinda silly. (I love Maximus though. I love the scene where little LG watching little Maximus from the side with Head Lady Noh). Another scene that I found a little bit annoying is when Luna stabbed JTE. Why JTE decided to confront Luna alone when she knows that Luna is dangerous and Eun Seop can easily be a back-up since he has been following Luna? Furthermore, there are a lot of advertisements. But, I gotta give thumbs up to the writer that she can weave them into the storyline. And now I'm still waiting for the last episode. I hope the writer is kind enough to give us a happy ending. At the very least, like she gave us the ending of Goblin. She was generous enough to give us an epilogue in the end of Goblin.<br/>\n",

       "I am completely fascinated by the plot of this drama. Amazingly put together, the entire concept and its characters. Mystery after mystery, slowly unravelling each plot makes you more excited about the upcoming episodes. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching 'The King: Eternal Monarch'. Extremely excited to see next week’s episode and how it will be completed. I really hope the ending of this drama will make a justice to the entire story. Lots of love to the team of 'The King: Eternal Monarch' for creating such a unique storyline. Being a drama lover, I would have to say that it is really satisfying to watch a fresh piece of work, that doesn’t just involve romance but considers other genres, characters and their relationships to the right level.<br/>\n",

       "Compared to other k-dramas, this would fall on the \"heavy\" side, needing the viewer to give more than the usual attention to the dialogues, and watching the previous episodes is a must, to understand the progression of the story. Yet over-all, I would still rate it as one of the best I have ever seen. LMH is undoubtedly the best among the best of actors, and he carried the drama extremely well from beginning to end. Considering all the restrictions of having to film during the covid outbreak, the staff (director, script writer, etc) still managed to come up with a great project. To all of you, specially LMH, a big kudos and more power. To me, in a scale of 1-10, I would rate this a grand 11. To those who got \"lost\" while watching, I suggest to watch it again, to fully understand the story. Again, congratulations for a job well done. And LMH, you haven't lost anything at all. You have proven once again that you are not just a pretty face, but one of the best actors ever.<br/>\n",

She cries well is about the only thing I can say. I just find her bland and uninteresting. I find the chemistry between the two leads to be very forced and unnatural. I am a huge fan of Lee Min-Ho but even he is having a hard time saving this drama.

This drama definitely requires FOCUS and time to understand. For me, I love it, waiting every week, reading and making up possibly “theories”, fangirling + crying over spectacular scenes. I understand why some people don’t like it but it goes straight up to my top 3, after Goblin and DOTS. Once you start, don’t stop cause it just gets better and better!! You will see how amazing each cast plays their role, how 2 and 2 are put together, and the amount of time and money spent into producing this drama. 10/10 highly recommend ??<br/>\n",

       "I get that the romance is somewhat exaggerated, but apart from that the plot and storyline is great. The plot has layers upon layers of mysteries and suspense, which really shows how much effort the writer has put into creating the drama. Although the romance is questionable, there is some chemistry between the leads. Lee Min Ho is very royalty material, which is a pleasure to watch. And not to mention Woo Do Hoon - he made me laugh so much. The cinematography is top-notch amongst other dramas this year, that's for sure!<br/>\n",

I can't help to compare it to The World of Marriage, which was airing at the same time slot, and now I just stop tuning into The King on Netflix. Utter disappointment, boring dragging plot with no climax, a waste of talented actors and actresses. This drama's product placement was severe. You'd think it's a 1 hour advertisement of people consecutively eating fried chicken, drinking The Alley boba milk tea, and smearing Laneige makeup. Nonetheless to say, I quit at 6th episode.

       "If a show needs twelve episodes to finally get interesting and pick up its pace, it cannot be the best drama of the season or the year or ever. As many have mentioned, the potential was there from the very start, but the pacing has always been problematic. Having a plot twist at the end of every episode, with the rest of it being very lacklustre, doesn’t qualify it to be a good drama. I get that many people have differing opinions about the chemistry between the leads, but truth be told, the scene stealers remain the supporting characters like WDH and the Prime Minister. LMH and KGE may have the star power as the leads, but think the writer has made their relationship overly convoluted and thus, too much of a soap opera.<br/>\n",

The story may seem hard to follow in some parts because the plot is so complicated but not everyone could have been able to develop it beautifully as the writer and the producer did, it is really an amazing job. Kudos to everyone who partecipated in KEM because it gives sooooo many emotions and many international fans love it and the chemistry between LM and GE is absolutely superb, the way they look at each other in the latest episodes is heart melting ❤? It's different from other dramas so for me it is a 100% ❤❤<br/>\n",

       "I do believe the leads have chemistry, a very intense one too, but man the story doesn't help them. It is as if the writer had a beautiful picture of a puzzle in his or her head but put the pieces all wrong and the result is distorted. Some times the plot is very slow, other times it's fine. Either way the drama manages to make you lose interest because of the inconsistency. And it is a pitty because the acting is great and the plot basis is solid. Is it the direction, is it the writing? For me it went south somewhere in there. Also, what the heck is their deal with sponsors? We get it you want to advertise but this is ridiculous.

It’s not in-your-face, annoying/cringe-y “cuteness” like many romcoms, but a subtle &amp; sweet chemistry with natural progression.

       "i've been watching TKEM since the beginning of the release, and i feel like the likeliness of the drama has gone through drastic highs and lows for me personally. the plot is amazing. it has so much potential, especially coming from the same screenwriter as goblin, descendants, mr. sunshine. etc. (she seriously has an amazing amount of skill!). but i say \"it has so much potential\" because it's a bit lacking for me. the romance felt so rushed, and i feel like the build up between taeul and gon is so vital to the structure of the plot...that it kind of just crumbles for me with how they poorly executed it. kim go eun's character is initially presented as standoffish and tough. it's presumable she's never even been in a relationship before. i love that kind of character who's responsible and focused on herself. it doesn't make sense that she goes from that to someone who is head over heals over the king in just one episode. where were the scenes where we saw her guard go down? no clips of subtle interactions that led to her falling in love with him? it just seems like she suddenly decided she was in love with him out of nowhere. their build up should've been much slower. i love every character individually, and like i said, amazing plot! but for me, the first few episodes really just killed it for me. now that were on episode 12 and there's only two more weeks left, the episodes have been beautifully presented in my opinion. episode 10-12 were lovely. i wished i felt the same energy in episodes 1-9 though...it just feels like wasted potential. :(<br/>\n",

       "Love the show. Watched it on Netflix probably not at the allotted time slot because of time difference between Korea and NY, USA. Love all the characters especially the main cast. It’s an adult role for LMH and he’s doing a great job portraying ‘The King’. Kim Go-Eun is my favorite actress and she did great. Love her looks. I did watched it again twice and now I appreciated the drama more and I had a better understanding of what the story is all about. But then again, who doesn’t watch LMH shows twice or more just to see him? ? Don’t forget that I don’t speak or understand the Korean language. Even so, I love the storyline, their facial expressions and the exchanges between the characters. It seems like a lot of thought and a lot of work had been put into this show and I enjoyed it. Thank you for this drama. Can’t wait for next episode. Stay safe.<br/>\n",

       "Am I the only one who wants a sad ending and lee lim to kill more people? I find a happy ending kind of unrealistic even though this drama is fantasy and there’s been too many hints that it’s a sad ending. If it’s a happy ending, that’s wonderful but I’m aiming for a sad ending if though LeeEul deserve happiness. Sometimes sad endings are meant to be and it’s good to have a good cry. I want Lee Lim to kill more people because I want to see more action going on. But yet again, there’s only 4 more episodes which makes me wonder how are they going to wrap up everything with so many unanswered questions and plot twists? I don’t think sbs will extended the episodes but could they perhaps extended the duration of the episodes? It’ll be better. I really enjoyed ep 11, I don’t know why it’s the lowest rating. Boy some of the other low rating episodes were kind of understandable but ep 11? Jeez what was south career even watching. I personally liked ep 11 and ep 12 very much. I know some people are not fond of LMH and KGE chemistry on screen but to me in ep 12, their chemistry was overflowing. I loved the kiss but why did the zoom out. Bruh like what were the camera directors thinking. Next time close up kiss and more scandalous ?. I can’t believe there’s only 2 more weeks left, it’s been a wild journey.<br/>\n",

Even when she was losing all hope and all of Lee Rin's men came, she stood her ground with only 2 bullets left. She's scare but she didn't drop and let them take her without a fight. She held the gun up, she's still willing to keep fighting until her last breathe. Calling for Lee Gon is a smart move since she is being chased by a lot of people and only Lee Gon knows her in this world. You'll be stupid to not make use of whatever you can in this situation.

       "Great acting. Fascinating, but highly detailed plot line. I love this. There are moments when it drags a little (even with all the wonderful details), and I have found myself thinking, \"Do they not have enough material?\", but otherwise, I am always anxious for the next episode - which to me is a very positive sign. I think that there may be just a few too many similarities with Goblin (two worlds, people appearing and disappearing into different time periods). It gives us a slight feeling of 'been there', or deja vu. As for all the pressure on this glorious writer, \"Y'all need to lighten up\". So many successful scripts, in a relatively short period of time - could you do it?<br/>\n",

       "</p><p>Then I started watching, if we look solely at the storyline, let’s be honest. It’s a gem, you can do so much with 2 worlds, people who look exactly the same as you, love that expands 2 worlds. But then the story started to unfold, my oh my, I’m dissatisfied. The first episode was perfect, an introduction. From the second episode the writer should’ve started to incorporate little things that would build up to the love arc. The love arc was too forced, which makes it less believable, hence why so many people say that can’t see the chemistry. Because it’s there, but for us viewers chemistry needs to have a foundation. Little things that draw us in and makes us want them to be together.\n",
       "</p><p>Because there are two worlds, we get introduced to many characters. The ones that live in our world and the people who live in the kingdom, each of them has a story and the drama tries to at least show us how the villain is replacing people.

The constant off editing doesn’t make it any better.\n",

The way he makes it totally believable that there are really 2 people with the same face but totally different characters. I’m loving every scene he’s in and he’s the reason i look forward to new episodes. He’s the one carrying the show, at least for me. I hope I haven’t offended anybody. This is my honest review. Please don’t question my intellect, because I get the story and the complicated plots and twists. I just think it’s poorly written and executed.<br/>\n",

       "This drama is still inside my cup of tea. I love the cinematography (though I hate the unsubtle products placements). The writer has had her hits, but actually this one is a lil bit of a miss. It could have been better had it been directed by another director. Yes to the comment re Goblin director. I personally still love watching it, but I get it why the ratings are not as expected. Each episode doesn’t have its own mini mystery to solve, not enough cliffhanger. It definitely doesn’t have enough oomph for a fantasy drama, almost too vanilla. Though I have to disagree with comments about the lacking main leads chemistry. I think they definitely have good chemistry, but it’s not oozing because of the way their storyline and characters are written. It’s a different kind of romance. I love it cause it feels realistic. A mature relationship between a king and a police officer, no push and pull. And Woo Do Hwan is just adorable in this drama! Would love to see more of Young and Eun Sup with Na Ri and Seung A. I will keep watching to the end. Despite everything, I’m still pulled into these two worlds.<br/>\n",

TBH, I also watched it to see the romance btw FL and ML (I Love Both of Them So MuchhhH, really great acting skills). However, after watching this drama, I actually fell in love with the story. Not only romance but everything. People just need to be more patient. This drama is really a masterpiece, filled with so many twist.

       "I loved ep 9 and 10. Ep 10 definitely did not have obvious PPL and I hope the next remaining episodes continues to do that. I believe that lee minho and Kim Goeun do have chemistry, maybe it isn’t the strong, however, I definitely know they have chemistry of screen from the behind the scenes. I’m really can’t wait for the next episode because of the preview. They can’t just leave us hanging like that. After reading some theories on twitter, I believe that it is Lee Gon’s future self who was kissing Taeeul at the end. He was wearing the same outfit we saw in ep 1: The words he was saying seemed a bit off and was kind of hinting something. Jung taeeul also stepped back when he met lee gon which makes me wonder why. Is it just me but I want Lee Lim to kill more people. Obviously not the main cast but other people because I want to see more action. I do think today’s episode did not flow smoothly. We had to go into about 20 minutes where we left off from ep 9. I think the beginning scenes could of been remove. Also, I’m sure the timelines were different because there were many cuts but it was not displayed. Overall I really enjoyed ep 9 and 10 were the best episodes. Really can’t wait for ep 11<br/>\n",

       "Just watched ep 10 on netflix, and i still couldn’t feel the chemistry between the ML and FL, their romance scenes lack any feelings and seems force to be there just to filled as a ‘garnish’ on top of your meal. And Since the first eps i start to compares this drama with Goblin, ii really loved goblin, the cinematography was superb, both if the drama has superb cinematography, but i just annoyed by the characters of FL on goblin, but i still can feels the romance between the ML and FL on goblin, at least the romance between the two are well developed, not perfect but i can understand and following their developing feelings for each other, and we know from the start the FL is the destined bride for ML. On the other hand, for The King, i can’t, the FL is less annoying than FL on goblin, really KGE characters as police woman on this drama is much way better cause the FL is strong, independent, and smart. But like other people says about the chemistry, the sudden “I Love You” what the f? How come you suddenly loved someone when on the previous eps the FL didn’t show any sparks of being fallin i love to the ML, even when ML kissed the FL, she barely show any feeling of love, come on, if she is a stright forward person why dont you make a better story telling for both of them to develops natural Love story, cause when i saw the scene FL said I Love You, the so many questions that crossed my mind : Am i missing some scene? How come she said I Love You with that straight face? Why you started to fall in love to the man who stalks you with no identity and seems crazy (cause he said he is the king from other world), and suddenly you fallen in love? Cause now you know he is the real king from another dimensions? I think what make it feels forces is because as long as I watched every episode both of them are barely talked deeply about each other as a couple, even the ML whose longing to meet FL is need more time to ensure his feeling for her, feels like they don’t know each other deeply to said love to each other, they dont have much time as a couple, they are from different world, so the writer and director should know better that they need a Good Romance story line to intertwined their fate as a couple<br/>\n",

I don't show much \"love\" as people would expect. I'm not mushy or lovey dovey. He's the one who does all that and that's fine. There are different kinds of love stories and I guess because LG and JTE's love story aren't the stereotypical one, people want to demean it. Her confession did seemed rush and that's because it was meant to be rushed. She knew they don't have much time left together so in order to spend the limited time they have together, she's rushing it. She confessed because she's already forseeing the short-lived relationship they'll have together and decided to accept living and loving with each other in the moment.<br/>\n",

I guess there are a lot of flaws in this drama and that everyone has different preferences, but I sincerely hope ratings can go up. I know ratings are not so important but it does kind of effect the drama. Anyways, I'm still going to watch regardless of the ratings. Sigh, I just feel sad for everyone who worked hard. Not enough people are appreciating it this complex, yet, beautiful drama<br/>\n",

       "I have a lot to say about this drama. I was really anticipating but I don’t think it has reached to my level of expectations. I’m still enjoying it but it’s not like a WOW drama. The actors are portraying their characters very well. Woo Dohwan, especially, is slaying his dual roles. I can’t believe it’s the same person playing eunseop and joyeong. Sorry but eunseop &gt;&gt;&gt; joyeong. I hope neither of them dies. The cinematography is out of this world, so so beautiful. One of the best cinematography in the kdrama world. The thing I like the most about this drama is the storyline. The storyline is so interesting and hasn’t been done before and I can’t wait to find out more about Lee Lim’s ambition and how Lee Gon will defeat him. Oh, and the theories. There are so many theories and I love reading them. Everyone are like detectives lol. However, there are some aspects about this drama which I wish can improve on. The romance is very bland. Sorry but you have to admit the truth. Even if you’re fans of both of the leads, you can immediately tell that the romance writing is lacking. I personally think there wasn’t enough romance build up between taeeul and lee gon. I’m head over heals with this pair but I understand why viewers are frustrated and confused on how taeeul fell for Lee gon, details were missing. Lee minho and Kim goeun have better chemistry off screen than on screen lol. I still love their romance moments though. One thing for sure that I know everyone is annoyed about is the amount of PPL. I know that every drama there’s PPL but TKEM’s PPL are too obvious. The cringy lines with it is so bad. The production crew can at least try to blend it more well and not make it so obvious. It feels like a commercial drama. Last con, the plot is too slow. There’s only three more weeks left until the drama ends and I don’t even know how they’re going to wrap this up smoothly. The action has only begun now and that’s more than half of the drama. The drama focused way too less on the main objective. Also, there are many secrets being revealed but it also feels like we know nothing at all. They’re saying so much but also nothing at the same time. I hope they don’t cram everything at the end. Nonetheless, I enjoy this drama. It’s my first ongoing kdrama that I’m watching from the very start and I’m always looking forward for the next episodes. I’m on twitter daily, scrolling and reading theories lol. I’m 70% sure it will have a sad ending. The amount of foreshadowing points it out. But you know, sometimes sad endings are meant to be and it’s good to have a cry sometimes. Anyways, I just really hope the ratings will go up soon. I hate how the Korean media always have something bad to say about this drama every week. It’s like someone is purposely trying to drag TKEM down. Please just stop. Looking forward towards the next episode:)<br/>\n",

       "up until today's episode I've tried to see the chemistry between the leads. I thought that I was too impatient. But its episode 9 already and this is the first time I don't feel any romantic connection between the main couple in all of the dramas I've watched. &amp; When I saw her confessing her feelings I was so shocked! Like what? how? when?. &amp; also the advertisements in this drama is so annoying so freaking annoying. I am so done with the coffee, the mask and the kimchi brand they are showing. It is so visible. The only thing that lets me continue the drama is because of do hwan! he deserves a million awards for his acting skills. He was able to portray both of the characters greatly.

       "This drama had a slow transition. For me, 1-6 episodes was a little bit dragging. Episode 8 is where the real action starts. But you cannot skip a single episode at the beginning because you will not understand the flow of the story. I love the ending of episode 8 and this is the reason why I couldn’t wait for episode 9. There are unnecessary scenes during the first half of this drama. I still do think that they could have done a better storytelling between Gon and Taeul’s affection for each other. But that is just one part of the story. Episode 9, their chemistry is finally showing. You just have to put aside the weird “love story” in the beginning. Now, there is definitely more action. The cinematography of this drama is fantastic! I’m not very fond of their songs, nothing really catchy for me but it worked out for most of the scenes. Everyone is doing a great job putting out their best acts. LMH might appear to be stoic in this drama but his subtle expressions and his overall aura just fits the role of a king. His deep voice can go from flat, to soft to fierce. I love it that his role is intelligent and fierce yet in front of Taeul and the old lady in the palace, he becomes soft. In episode 9, LMH’s acting really stood out. I can now truly, truly say that this is an amazing drama! This show is a good one and probably one of the most interesting dramas I have ever watched. The dark side of this story is what really pulls me. You become so immersed to it because it makes you think. Some people don’t like it but as long as I like it, who cares about opinions. Koreans should be proud that they have talented people who can bring out an awesome project like this one. I think it is underrated and it just doesn’t make sense to me. All the actors in this drama were so on point. I hope they get plenty of rewards. Kudos!<br/>\n",

       "So glad that so many of the recent comments point out the deficiencies of this drama, rather than just blindly fangirling over the leads or gushing over the non-existing chemistry between the leads. I really wanted to like this drama a lot because I enjoy a good sci fi series once in a while, and the premise of the parallel worlds looked really interesting. However the writers seemed to be dragging out the drama on purpose. By the time it reached ep 5 and that weird kiss thing happened, I stopped watching. From the latest comments, it looked as if the female lead’s confession also didn’t make sense to some viewers. I don’t doubt that the leads have huge fan bases, but even in the few eps that I watched, I found the supporting actors more intriguing. I may come back to this later if the pace and storyline improve, but it’s definitely not because of the painfully dreary love story between the leads.<br/>\n",

       "The plot was very confusing during the first 4 episodes. I had to repeat those episodes few times in order for me to understand where the flow of the story is going. I agree that there are just too many cheesy lines, I am not excited with the love story but more on the mystery of this drama. LMH is just given a script to act on. His acting goes well with him being a king. He is not supposed to act like a clown. He is supposed to be more serious, intelligent and very much well educated. That was the character that he is supposed to play. I agree as well that his character here is a bit bland but I don’t think he is a bad actor. He is not the best actor but to say that he is horrible with his acting is just not right. It’s difficult to compare all their acts in this drama because they are all given different roles to play. I think they all did their parts well. As for the romance, I cannot understand this love story at all. The FL doesn’t seem to show that she fell in love with him. If she did, I cannot find it in any of the episodes that’s already out. I guess I am just not feeling the love story of the lead couple. There’s no building up. It feels like out of nowhere, there comes love that only the actors of the drama, the director and scriptwriter can understand. This is what’s missing from this drama. I don’t blame the actors. I blame it more on how it was written. This parallel world concept may not appeal to many people but for me, it is quite interesting. I love the mystery of this drama and it is quite unique. You will get confused the first time you watch it and that’s why paying attention to each character, each event is very important when you watch this drama. 8 episodes out already and now I can see how it will turn around. It may not have the best ratings but it is not a bad drama. You just need patience and pay attention with their lines, events and people in order for you not to get lost. Don’t be too harsh on the actors of this drama. I am sure they are doing their best to bring out the characters to life. No matter how famous they are, they do get hurt. Your harsh words are like stones being thrown at them and they didn’t do anything bad to you. All they did was to act and bring entertainment.<br/>\n",

       "Same stoic LMH face, anyway what else to expect from him? I think the side actors are doing much better especially WDH and KKN. Their stories and acting are extremely better than the male lead. The back story of SJ's much more interesting and something to look forward to. WDH's double role is outstanding, he's a show stealer here. The romance isn't there or maybe because the writer thinks that it'll make our heart flutter even before establishing the main lead's loveline, but no at least not for me. The cheesy lines are for fangirls only, nothing more. The confessions of both leads was like reciting an English poem in front of the class, it feels cringey rather than cute. Bromance isn't reaching my liking as well, it's funny that I see bromance between Jo Eun Seob and Jo Yeong more. Watching this only for WDH and KKN.\n",
       "</p><p>The rating's speak for itself, barely hitting double digits. We're already half of the drama and I think ML is more focused on his obsession with the FL. Anyway, there's a lot of upcoming drama out there that's more interesting.<br/>\n",

       "I like the drama so far. Not going to lie, I often wondered how Korea would have been if the last king had not been dethroned. It makes me sad to see that years of history were destroyed and Korea had been split into two. I also heard that the north has a lot of natural resources that S. Korea now has to have imported from other countries which is also a bummer. This drama is good though. I love how the story is flowing and how it gives you just enough to be satisfied until the next episode while keeping enough to itself so you continue to watch to figure out what will happen and who will win. My only complaint is how much product placement they have...the bottled coffee, the alley milk teas, bbq olive chicken.....too much<br/>\n",

       "And @C. It doesn't have to always be that way, i mean the “I love you”, that u must feel something, it should be sudden and unexpected sometimes as in this drama. I love the way they didn't drag it out, her affection towards Lee Gon, I mean, in some dramas, there will come a scene that u would already knw that the “I love you” is gonna come, after all the play hard to get. In this case she has been thinking about it for a while and she just has to let it out as there are better things to do going forward in the movie like eliminating the enemies and closing the gate between the parallel worlds. So I think it's better to pronounce the love earlier and not get the useless thoughts of when to tell him confusing her head, and focus on both of 'em joinin forces to overcome the obstacles.

I don't get why the King was so smitten with her when he first saw her. I mean yes he does know her for 24 years but not as a love interest. The ID was just the nearest connection he has for his savior and that's that. However, the way it was written makes it looks like he loves her all his life. The romance scene was so abrupt.

       "Ok. 1. First of, The reason why a lot of people find this drama boring, is because there is no endgame in sight, we cant connect with the characters because they’re written in such a dry manner. No one seems to have a personality (the only interesting take at the moment is the body gaurd and his doppelgänger). There is no build up towards a romantic relationship and there’s no real connection between the two main characters. It literally came out of nowhere and didn’t make any sense. The female lead is a spectacular actress, but she’s unemotional throughout and because lee min ho’s character is reserved, it just doesn’t balance each other out. She hasn’t expressed ANY believable feelings for him. They could literally just be friends. They didn’t do anything together to solidify that this was going in a romantic direction and they both ended up being dry. So you can’t feel anything deep between the two. As for the story? Because they want to DRAG this mysterious role that the villain is playing, It ends up making watchers lose interest. They’ve literally been dragging his goal for like 8 episodes straight. We watch and then realize what he’s up to. We can’t feel who these characters are because we haven’t been given any emotions or memories/ flashbacks: encounters to make us feel for them. So we know WHO they are, or how they were before. Besides the body gaurd and the prime minister, everyone else is just bland.<br/>\n",

       "I have a question if anyone can answer me. So in the Kingdom of Corea, Lee Gon is the king since I imagine he was the descendants of many kings before him. But in the republican. of korea, lee gin read somewhere that one of the king died so that’s why the two universe are so different but if the king died in the republic that means that he didn’t have any descendants right? Or is children would have taken his place? so that means that lee gon’s parent shouldn’t have been born in the republic and neither would have lee gon. I don’t know that much about korean history but did the king who died have children or not? maybe the two parallel universe also don’t connect with history so idk<br/>\n",

The writer explore the most bizarre things out there then give us a one of a kind plot (pls see what other dramas she have written).

Tbh the drama is good, quite confusing at the early episode buttt if u patient, u can understand the plot i think. The problem is maybe from editing. there are still many scenes that lack of background music. for example, there is one funny scene in ep 5, but bcuz there are no bgm, its just feel flat...like serious scene. The CGI i think they can do more from that. I hope the director can evaluate the previous episodes and fix them.

       "My first time to comment on k-dramas - the new normal that covid19 made me of ? 1) The screenwriter has proven her worth with her famous works which are distinct from one another. And the satisfaction it gave to viewers remain. TKEM challenges the IQ and EQ of likers, lurkers, and haters. And that made the story more interesting. Lead cast openly expressed their initial confusion but after reading the entire script they liked the original concept of a fictional parallel world (RK and fictional KC) and the unique dual characters they need to work on 2) The portrayal of actors/actresses varies on the personality/background of the character they are assigned to. Lee Gon is a mathematician (stigma: serious, scientific, assertive, theory based, above all geek, not much of the demonstrative type) before he became the king. LMH is able to muster and deliver the opposing attributes of his character. Jeong Tae-eul is motherless at 5y.o., a street smart kid who decided to become brave that's why she became a detective. She is straightforward, no-nonsense, with issues on showing her femininity or the lady in her. And yes, KGE delivered it well! As for the rest of the cast, a big round of applause to all of them!!! They've been doing great!!! 3) On chemistry of LMH and KGE? we hv subjective / personal biases on this .... but the behind the scenes and interviews expressly and impliedly showed the degree of chemistry they've developed. So it's a thumbs up! 4) for the CGI, i dont have issues on it coz im after the essence of the scene and 5) As for the rating, I am confident the succeeding episodes will draw in attention with heightened mystery, shared loved (70% of LeeGon's mind is.occupied by Jeong Tae-eul), action and unexpected turn of events (wch screenwriter Kim Eun-soo is known for).<br/>\n",

       "I agree with those here that say how interesting the concept is but the execution is either boring or confusing. In medical dramas, even if they spew all those terms i do not understand, it's fine by me. But here, nope, just have to skip those math stuff. Maybe because the med terms in the dramas help move the story forward but the math terms here looks like they're used simply to rub the fact that yes, the king is a mathematician and yes, this is a scifi/fantasy drama. Even the story telling is slow. Hope the upcoming episodes are better. I really have expectations for this show.<br/>\n",

She always give the best background of the story eventhough not all really understand what it is about from the first episode but I am sure she will build the story well.

       "I am personally disappointed at this drama. The story is promising but the execution has not been good, so far. 6 episodes and the plot is moving nowhere. No chemistry between LMH and KGE. The kiss seemed so forced. Dialogues are so cheesy. LMH is still acting like when he was in BOF, Inheritors and so on. The most annoying thing is the product placement, it is really in your face.<br/>\n",

       "It reminds me of vanessa hudgens’ movie... lol. But i mean yeah, the story is interesting. Some parts feel slow. LMH’s acting is idk, its kinda boring as usual. I agree with the comment below that he puts me to sleep too lol. No offense. He’s just hot, that’s all. I like Woo do hwan/Joyoung’s character and acting more, serious in another world and funny or playful in another world. Loved his accent too. So far, i like kim go eun’s character here too, better than Goblin. The show also feels like another Goblin show, but i find this more interesting than Goblin (i dropped that one). It’s a little bit confusing at some parts, but bearable. I just skip the science part or math coz i have no idea what theyre talking about. Anyways, i’m probably gonna keep on watching. It’s definitely not the best show, but it looks like a high budget show, and the cinematography is good. The casts are popular but not the best actors in my opinion. That is probably why they got high ratings. Story is interesting though a little confusing and slow, and sometimes boring and doesnt make sense. But i like guns and im hoping for some action, and I like the OSTs, so 50/50 i might end up finishing this or not.<br/>\n",

Yes, the cinematography is great, but with all the new dramas coming out with interesting plot, this show just falls short of what I expected from the writer.

If u really hate it n are bored why not watch some other drama.... Or u can name it to others.... They should also know... And compare it with that.... It's unique in it's own way....

       "This drama thus far has given me mixed feelings. I have watched all 4 episodes and it has made confused, but at the same time, it’s really interesting. The cinematography , acting of the actors and overall, the plot has really caught my attention. Although confusing in the first 3 episodes, episode 4 has really proven to me that I should keep watching and supporting this drama. Towards the ending of the episode, we can see the development in not only the story, but the relationship between the 2 main characters (watch it for yourself if curious ;)). So, if you are unsure to watch it or not due to the ratings, I suggest that you give this drama a try. As I said before, the first few episodes are slow-paced, but trust me, it gets better.\n",

       "Watched the first two episodes and was totally entranced. There's always something to look for in every scene: a clue, the majestic backgrounds, and the beautiful faces of the cast (especially Lee Minho's because he is extremely pleasing to look at). I rewatched the first two episodes at least three times and I was glad I did because I made some theories about certain scenes that I missed. Also, there are little details in Lee Minho's and Woo Dohwan's acting that I missed and it gave me butterflies when I caught them (Lee Minho's smirks, and Woo Dohwan's eyebrow twitch and steely gaze). This week's episodes (3-4) have been quite exciting because we are finally getting to the action of the plot that requires the characters to constantly interact with each other (especially Lee Minho's and Kim Goeun's characters because I love the two of them together so much- they have a different dynamic that leaves me hilariously feeling bad for Lee Minho's character). I really can't wait for episodes 5-6 because whew.. for a person who only has four episodes of Lee Minho's incredibly handsome face, it's really not enough. And also, I want to see how the plot unfolds with the first (hopefully not because he has an important piece of information) death of a major/minor character ;).<br/>\n",

For example, when the characters have conversations that are suppose to be funny or when they are joking around, there is no background music to support the lightheartedness of the scene, so it ends up being either very awkward for the audience or we have to read the subtitles again to get that they were joking. It feels so stiff without the little background music like there's not enough emotion to support the scene. The only parts where they put the background music is at the end of the drama.

There was a huge hype and expectations for this drama but its actually so boring. The pacing is very strange, and there is little that makes the audiences actually care about these characters. The idea is really interesting and had huge potential, but the execution has been terrible. Having cliches isn't inherently bad, and they can work really well for some dramas, but this entire drama is a boring cliche. I know there's this whole narrative that we should all just sit tight and hope for better episodes to come, but if the drama doesn't gattract you in you the first episods then it's not worth eatching<br/>\n",

       "First of all, I wanted to praise this drama in its overall aspect. Oh My God, this is so amazing. And it is mind-blowing. I really missed the fast-paced direction of kim-eun Suk's drama. I am talking about the directing here. As we noticed, DOTS has a fast-paced direction, while Goblin and Mr. Sunshine have more deep and slow-paced direction. In this drama, fast, fun and smooth pacing is combined with deep and dramatic directing elements, which makes this film so beautiful. The angles are beautifully and expressively captured on slow parts at the same time, there are smooth and sharp action on its fast parts.\n",
       "</p><p>Now let's talk about the story. It was refreshing for me and I was on the edge of my seat watching how the story goes. Honestly, I have so many theories when it comes to time-space bending and multiverse. My mind actually wanders a lot when I see many mathematical equations and amazingly, I can see these in this drama. Mathematical equations being shown here might have a much deeper significance in its plot.\n",
       "</p><p>The location of the scar of Lee Gon not making sense might somehow have a much deeper explanation. I am even confused with the time relations, As we can see some characters appearing in a specific time, when it is impossible. The female lead appears to save the young Lee gon from his uncle. But how is it possible? Could it be a foreshadowing of the future events that the female lead might encounter as the drama progresses? My God, help me uncover this.<br/>\n",

I love korean dramas especially fantasy-genre. The 1st episode really hooked me up. Before we judge this drama, we need to see more episodes of TKEM because other said it is disappointing, how can you judge the drama when you only watched 1 episode? Anyways I’m looking forward and will patiently waiting for the next episodes. Fighting!<br/>\n",

This is the first time that i am waiting for a drama to come out for months. i only started watching k-drama since about April/ may 2019 so mainly a lot of good dramas were already out. The funny thing is that one of the first dramas or probably the first k-drama that i watched was Heirs around April last year and after 1 year another drama with Lee Min Ho will come out in the same month.<br/>\n",

       "Am I the only one kind of disappointed in the lead actress? Kim Go-Eun is an AMAZING actress, but I was hoping that Park Shin Hye would be the leading actress alongside Lee Min Ho. The reason is because Descendants of the Sun, Goblin, and Mr. Sunshine are all connected to each other, and they are also all amazing, so I was hoping for this story to be Park Shin Hye x Lee Min Ho, since they were in The Heirs together.\n",
       "</p><p>They would have been a part of the connection between the 3 recent Kim Eun Sook dramas, and Park Shin Hye and Lee Min Ho would have been given a second chance at having a Kim Eun Sook drama that would have actually had quality writing compared to The Heirs. We could have had them love each other in another life, which would have been amazing.\n",
       "</p><p>Then I was hoping Kim Eun Sook would get the 2 leads from A Gentleman's Dignity and give them a better drama and also connect it to the other 3. I feel like it was a missed opportunity to not give the leading actress role to Park Shin Hye.\n",
       "</p><p>But the director did change so I guess those 3 will be independent from the rest of Kim Eun Sook's future dramas unless they collaborate again.\n",
       "</p><p>Still, I'm just so disappointed that Park Shin Hye wasn't the leading actress and instead Kim Go-Eun.\n",
       "</p><p>But maybe this is a one-off deal, and her next story will connect to her previous 3 dramas and add on to that. Maybe Lee Min Ho will get another Kim Eun Sook drama with Park Shin Hye, and maybe it will be of quality content. This drama does sound a bit unrealistic. I know Goblin was unrealistic in its own ways, but it was also realistic in its own ways. This drama just sounds like a fantasy story however, so maybe it is just a one-off.<br/>\n",

       "For some reason i feel like the writer is establishing herself as a fantasy-based screenwriter. I really like Goblin so i'm sure as hell on board with this. I see it as a redemption that this screenwriter made for having LMH to star in the so generic boring Heirs drama a few years back by offering him this epic piece (i hope it's going to be epic tho!). Honestly speaking i'm a little confused with the plot tho. So in this drama, is LMH going to be playing dual roles (bromance involving dual roles??? that's something new lol) or is the Korean Emperor version of LMH's character would be taking over LMH's present day character carrying out what the other version of his has to do while at the same time taking care of his own business? Seems like i'm gonna have to wait for more updates on this drama. Whoever the leading actress i don't mind but i hope it is not an actress who cannot act all that much and ruins what possibly could affect the best traits of the leading actress, popular actress or not is not even something that really matters as long as it's good.<br/>\n",

I think their chemistry is really good. TKEM is not the usual Kdrama. It is worth it... I'll be shipping Kim Go Eun and Lee Min Ho forever they look good together.

       " I've finished the 16th episode. I don't really know what to say. Even if this drema would have huge ratings, I couldnt like it too much. But perhaps it's a bit objective that people got bored with it. I liked the ending, although for some reason couldnt get on with feeling bored. I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on. Is it the dialogues, always the way they talk like riddles. I've lost interest and sometimes couldnt get on what's going on. I'm not sure about any international success it has, but I couldnt enjoy it really much for some reason. I had to watch this, i dont feel like i wasted time. I liked some stories, some things were really emotional. But just not that good. I'd totally prefer Secret Garden over it. It was amazing. Why? I guess screenwriting, directing and all other things really matter and no matter if the story is complex, mysterious or good, without all other elements it doesnt work. I don't think I'll rewatch this.<br/>\n",

       " So, I'm not sure which fault is that. Plot is actually pretty interesting, and script too. It couldve been one of the best dramas in 2020... But there were something wrong with everything else. I'll list you all things what I believe went wrong.\n",
       " </p><p>Directing and editing:\n",
       " The drama was very slow, but the pacing is never a problem. I hate comparing, but I cannot avoid to do so with Goblin. It had slow pacing in a lot of moments, but the directing and screenwriting made it all very good, very balanced and harmonic. Same goes to something like CLOY. Soundtrack, OSTs fitted and everything worked perfectly. Fast pacing never makes a series or a drama a better thing as itself, but the directing and editing does. And this flopped here. There were so much of unnecessary things that could be avoided and fast-paced. During the episode 6, which is a pinnacle of boredom in the show, the battle with Japanese ships I cringed and laughed my ass off for all the unnecessary filling and stuff that has been happening there. I were numb when I suddenly bursted out with laughter. They tried to make this so epic with all these camera angles and epic faces of Lee Min Ho and Woo Do Hwan that I laughed so hard I nearly shat my pants. Sorry guys. Same with the scene where cops chasing suspects... in the very same time of episode. It was shown the most boring way it could've been. It didnt work. And there were a lot of these things. Sometimes my interest woke up, but then it disappeared, and then again and again.\n",
       " </p><p>Characters:\n",
       " The characters were greatly written (not all tho, I still couldnt understand necessarity of Prime Minister and all her scenes in first half of the show) but again, directing made them boring. I were trying to think why and how this show bores me. It just couldnt have made me hooked. The only moments I remember I didnt feel bored was when Eun Sup showed up on screen, when someone died or when Lee Gon went mad on killing everyone. Everything else - sometimes I really had to force myself on looking on screen. I hate to say this, but this ain't good.\n",
       " </p><p>Chemistry:\n",
       " Between main leads - I dont know. Feelings of Jeong Tae-Eul came out of nowhere really. She cries at some points and it doesnt work for her character and for me, or at least they didnt show how it should've been. And Lee Min Ho - his potential was realised only somewhere near the end of the show, but before I was bored looking at his numb face and idle poses they've been practicing a lot.\n",
       " </p><p>Storytelling:\n",
       " Its very messy. Why so many unnecessary characters, stories. At some point I've stopped understanding what's going on and had to rethink how certain things are affecting anyone in the series. Oh and there were little accents on moments where there should have been. It was messy as I said earlier. I couldnt remember a lot of names because of that, and lost my interest almost to everyone except main characters (because I was interested what's gonna happen next; I lost my sympathy and enjoyment somewhere in first episodes). The music were just for the background, wasnt fitting in a lot of moments. Sometimes it was so epic I cringed. OSTs were very actually very good tho. When they started to play, I became a bit alive.\n",
       " </p><p>Every episode, I swear, I was trying to look at from zero, without prejudice. And guess what - I could handle to watch only first few minutes with enjoyment, but the other hour is me being bored but forcing myself to watch because I'm interested in the thing itself and hoping for better episodes.\n",
       " </p><p>The show has so much of flaws that its gonna take a while to proceed them all. Apparently, this is going to be example that good investment, characters and story can be ruined by poor directing, editing and storytelling. This is going to be example how you shouldn't make a show.\n",
       " </p><p>People shouldn't suggest that it flopped because of advertisements. If the show was good enough, it wouldnt matter, even tho there were too much of ads and it was too direct that I couldnt help but cringe. But the show itself wasnt as good. I liked it somewhere, enjoyed it a bit. It gave some goosebumps but I just felt something isnt really right. The last like 6-7 episodes were a lot better than first ones, but still sometimes it was boring. And the drama could've been very good, but it turned out this. You should try watch it for yourself, but I dont think I would do it again. I'm kind of tired of it. I'm in the middle of 15th episode and I'm sleepy.<br/>\n",

       " I loved this story. It is exceptionally well written, directed and acted. And it would have been perfect, except for the ending. I think it suffers from a problem that is endemic in modern storytelling and betrays a problem in modern thought. It seems that these days it is considered smart to get a college education and settle in a job before you get serious about relationships. To my mind, this story points out the flaw in that way of thinking. As so many stories do, it starts with two people with fully developed lives in different worlds. By that I mean they each has an education, job, family, and relationships they have strived their whole life to make for themselves. This presents a problem for a romantic story, because one of them will ultimately have to give up their world to be with the other. While this story does as brilliant a job as can be done in working with that problem, it is one that is never satisfyingly resolved even to the very last frame. Ultimately we are left feeling that each one puts more value on their job than they do on the person they are supposedly desperate to be with.<br/>\n",

       " SPOILER\n",
       " </p><p>About the scar, what a bummer. They made such a big deal out of it then I felt like they dropped the ball on it. Ok, here's some more thoughts ...\n",
       " </p><p>Yo-Yo Boy (Aka: the spirit of the Manpasikjeok)\n",
       " He is basically the gate keeper and controls access to all the parallel worlds. He has the ability to appear in any physical form (young or older) and moves between worlds at will. Whichever physical form he appears in is probably dependent on what he needs to accomplish.\n",
       " </p><p>The Yo-Yo I'm surprise no one has mentioned the yo-yo and what is its purpose. Here's my 2 cents on this topic. Basically, the yo-yo represents the parallel worlds. You always see the boy constantly moving the yo-yo. This is symbolic of him doing his basic function which is to keep the parallel worlds in perpetual motion and in balance. Think of each of the two discs of the yo-yo as parallel world opposites separated from each other by a string and Yo-Yo boy is there to ensure all worlds are in balance and working the way they should be.\n",
       " </p><p>When the Manpasikjeok was broken in half, it took some of the control of the worlds out of yo-yo boy's hands and into the hands of whoever has the Manpasikjeok pieces. Lee Lim's activities were basically causing the entire yo-yo to be out of balance. The Corea side of the yo-yo was heavy with activities. If that keeps up, the yo yo will not work right to the point where it will be noticeable. Hence the bleed throughs into both Corea/Korea such as people in both worlds experiencing flashes of their dopplegangers. Ultimately, if nothing is done to correct the imbalance, the yo-yo will actually stop working. This was already well on its way; the more the Corea citizens affect changes in Korea, the longer time freezes. Ultimately, all parallel worlds would come to a stand still at some point (AKA time freezes forever and so is life as we know it).\n",
       " </p><p>In order to restore balance, Yo-Yo boy needed a force to counter the Lee Lim force that caused the imbalance. This force, however, can not come from the Kingdom of Corea because that is where the driving force that messed things up came from - Lee Lim. The driving force to restore balance must come from the Republic of Korea to balance things out. Just imagine you and I having an arm wrestling contest. If I am winning and I'm able to pull your arm past the midpoint toward my side, the only way that balance can be restored is if you exert enough force to bring yourself back to the midpoint. Now apply this same concept to Corea/Korea with me being Corea and you being Korea.\n",
       " </p><p>A perfect example of why the Corea side can not restore the balance is in Episode 14. When both Lee Lim &amp; the King were inside the place between-zero-and-one at the same time, it made the Manpasikjeok \"whole\" again. They both had an equal chance to change events that night but things still didn't turn out the way they wanted. The 2020 Lee Lim got killed by the 1994 Lee Lim and the King didn't make much of a change to his past situation. Their efforts did not work because the driving force and catalyst to fix both worlds must come from Korea - the other half of the yo-yo.\n",
       " </p><p>Yo-Yo boy choose Tae-Eul to be that force to provide the equal and opposite reaction to put things in motion and back into balance. Why? Because she is the exact opposite of what Lee Lim stands for, she wants the worlds to be balanced AND she has the courage to pull it off. That was her fate. I think symbolically, she is the red string on the yo-yo. I googled it and this actually exists! \"The Red Thread of Fate is an East Asian belief originating from Chinese mythology. It is commonly thought of as an invisible red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are \"their true love\". ...The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. \"\n",
       " </p><p>In the last episode, the yo-yo boy &amp; teenage boy were shown as flashbacks in Tae-Eul's life to conveyed that he has been keeping an eye on Tae-Eul all along. If you need more proof of Tae-Eul's fate, rewatch the order of things in the last episode.\n",
       " </p><p>Her first successful shot went off which represented the force that was needed to get the yo yo going again and the 2 worlds back on track. You know everything is back on track because immediately right after the successful shot:\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <pre>-  The lily plant begins to grow the green shoot.  (Proof that time no longer freezes)\n",
       " </pre>\n",
       " <p>- There is now wind in the place between-zero-and-one. You can see the wind because her hair was blowing.\n",
       " - In the King's between-zero-and-one place, all the red balloons and other stuff are now moving in the air.\n",
       " - Lee Lim's body disintegrated in the between-zero-and-one place and his watch that was left was actually working and not frozen in time.\n",
       " - The events that were the result of the 2 worlds crossing disappeared. For example, Sin-Jae's pic from Tae-ul's world.\n",
       " </p><p>Note that after she fired the successful shot then the King took care of Lee Lim. (At first I thought it was weird the order of things and had to really use my brain cells to figure this one out.)\n",
       " </p><p>The Fast Romance: diehardfan explains it the best. You have to understand it could be at least 3-4 months by the time they see each other next. So while apart, they are actually not apart because they were thinking of each other and longing to be in the company of each other. This is why the next time they see each other, they keep saying, \"I missed you\", or \"Have you been waiting for me?\" It just solidifies the saying, \"Absence makes the heart grows fonder\".\n",
       " </p><p>This is really not your typical romance. If you don't know when or if you will ever see the other person again, you will probably do what they do - gladly accept your fate and live in the moment. Cause all you really are guaranteed is just that moment. I think if they put a time caption on when the King meets Tae-Eul next (ex: \"6 months later\") that would help the audience understand their time constraints better.\n",
       " </p><p>Shin-Jae Jeez, Kim Kyung-Nam is just too cool. His acting was just spot on when his mother ran out to give him a hug…. and he didn't even have to say one word. Bravo!!!\n",
       " </p><p>Overall, I don't recommend this show for just anyone. If you are a deep thinker and like to solve a good mystery then this is right up your alley. It's really a show that keeps on giving because it does require a lot of utilizing the brain cells to get the full impact of the plot. Even after rewatching things, you start to notice more clues that you didn't really notice before. I love it and hoping there will be a sequel!<br/>\n",

Overall the concept of parallel worlds, acting &amp; cinematography is great. However the script is so poorly written that it has so many plot holes.

       " I avoided this drama because everywhere I read about it people were complaining about how convoluted or boring it was. Also, I don't hate LMH but I'm always skeptical about his projects because most of the time they're fan-driven rather than story-driven. Worst of all, at the time it was airing The World Of The Married had me by the throat so I had no room for anything else. Last night, I was bored so I decided to throw away one or two hours on this drama to see why everyone hated. And thus commenced the marathon.\n",
       " </p><p>A day later, I'm done and I have to say it's not as bad as sold. I mean it's not 'Mr. Sunshine' but it's on par with Goblin. It's shine was just dulled by the fact that it was up against a power-house drama. Most of the things people found confusing were just because they were impatient. If you're a person who enjoys mysteries, you'll love seeing the unexplained twists slowly unraveling. As for the claims of lack of chemistry between the leads, it's obviously a rumor made up by people who haven't watched 'Lovely Horribly' . Lee Gon and Tae-Eul's relationship started fast but when it caught on, it was bittersweet and kept on pulling at my heartstrings.\n",
       " </p><p>I feel like everyone who had a doppelganger gave applause-deserving performances. Jo Young's loyalty was un-parelled no matter the universe. Shin-jae impressed me because he was the one who had the most to lose by doing the right thing, and yet he still did it. The P.M.... lol. Obviously, she's just bad in every single version of herself in the different words.\n",

       " People’s opinion about this drama is either they hate it or love it . I’m one of those people who found it boring around ep.6-9 but after rewatching it I was blown away how many I’ve missed and totally live it after that. This drama gave me a unique experience where it’s my first time commenting online even joining a group just to share my theories , spend hours searching different peoples theories even studied some math/ science related stuff. I might not be good drama for others but for me this is the Best Drama for me not just because the story , and actors but the experience that this drama gave me it makes me interact with the stranger just to share a theory and I feel like I made new friends because of this drama. Im not a fan of Lee min ho. I can’t even finish most of his drama as they’re just typical cliche. As for Kim Go Eun I know that she’s an excellent actress but I can say that Goblin is not for me . This drama made me a fan for both of them.I thank the writers, actors and crew for making this extraordinary drama despite the criticism and harsh bashing . I know more extra ordinary drama will come but TKEM will always be special to my Heart. Thank you for the experience . I’m crying ?<br/>\n",

       " Long story short, this kdrama was a roasted chicken with no seasoning. It's the kind of chicken that you consider a decent meal, but it won't leave you hanging and hoping to eat it again later, nor will you remember it.\n",
       " </p><p>While I agree with other comments that Lee Min Ho was quite emotionless in this role, the drama on its own failed to bring out any tears or feelings. Although the drama does cover the suffering of many people between the two worlds, their stories always lacked depth and ended up being undeveloped.\n",
       " </p><p>At the same time, the drama constantly clung onto safety and refused to let anyone important die. As an example (SPOILERS ahead), when both the Royal Guard Captain and his comedian counter-part from the other world got shot and were saved by their bulletproof vests, the writer missed a good opportunity to kill off the comedian counter-part and introduce the consequences of mixing fates of people from two parallel dimensions. That would have resulted in an actual tear jerker this drama needed, and a significant challenge for Lee Gon's and Tae Eul's romance.\n",
       " The only time this drama was close to a tear jerker was when Lee Gon's uncle died, however even that was too sudden and didn't have the impact it should have had, it just happened out of nowhere, but also didn't surprise me.\n",
       " </p><p>I can't help but compare it to Goblin since the drama has a similar concept and the same female lead actress... Goblin somehow succeeded in making a story that didn't have an obvious plot or ending, whereas Eternal Monarch just stuck with the recycled. Overall this kdrama does not have any re-watch value for me, the romance between the leads was pretty shallow overall.<br/>\n",

       " SPOILERS! I can understand why people are complaining that this flopped after episode 13. The whole time travelling thing became a big problem and that is because it created so much loop holes in the drama. Letting them keep their memory was the biggest loop hole in the drama since it cannot correspond with the past they later created. If the past really changed then he should never have known her hence their memory should not exist. Then there is the problem with lee lim, if he was killed by his past self then the drama has ended because the bad guy is gone but since he still existed that means we followed the one that did the killing, then that would mean there are more lee gon travelling through time since he has never died. Argh! this is so twisted, they should have just made them fall in love with their respective world selves.

With all the twists and turns it was awesome and fantastic. I started watching it because of Lee Min Ho as I waited long for his comeback and I think I would have loved it despite the story due to his presence but over time I started to like the other actors as well especially Woo Do Hwan. I was indeed surprised by his switching of dialects and was really amazed at his portraying of entirely different characters. Even when Jo Yeong disguised as Eun Seop, we could still feel yeong in him. All the characters were well portrayed and the villain was also just amazing. This will be one of the best drama of 2020 and it really helped me keep sane during these quarantine times. Thanks to the director and cast for giving this amazing drama. One word...Daebak!<br/>\n",

       " One last thing is about the excessive product advertisement that distracts the viewers after some time but enough people complained about it already.\n",
       " So I hope the show creators took a lesson from low ratings and negative reviews about the show that I've seen a lot and spend their time and resources next time to good writing as they did before. The previous shows of the writer (e.g., secret garden, goblin, mr sunshine etc.) had problems as well. I remember finding some story lines and scenes unnecessary. However, not as much as this one.<br/>\n",

       " The King Eternal Monarch is different level of other drama, this drama shows us another story especially about parallel world. I know this drama really make me think a lot about theory but i do enjoy it so much. The message, the script, the acting of Kim Go Eun and Lee Min Ho, their chemistry are the best for me. The cinematography of this drama also very beautiful.\n",
       " I never regret any second from watching this drama. Its a masterpiece, indeed.\n",

       " How every eps connect with other eps, and how a very little detail actually really matters and have a meaningful message from this drama is beyond amazing.\n",
       " and one of the most beautiful thing from this drama is the love story of Jung Tae Eul and Lee Gon, its actually very sad seeing they always have to face lots of problem due to the parallel world and their enemy, but in the same time its really beautiful to see how they encourage each other, how they keep strong and have a belief in their relationship, damn can you imagine loving someone from another world? you cant call, text or write a letter for your love, you can only waiting patiently and trust your partner. it really hurts indeed.\n",
       " But Lee Gon and Jung Tae Eul always try to figure it out and being strong each other...\n",
       " I'm truly amazed by their acting skills, really.\n",

       " I think this is the first drama that Lee Min Ho's female lead is younger than him. They did a good job together, as predicted. They are good actors. The idea is interesting and really good. However, I find some scenes are kinda absurd, like how LG found JTE after she was abducted. Why did he has to bring cavalry while he could easily ride cars? I suppose it made a great dramatic scene, but I think it was kinda silly. (I love Maximus though. I love the scene where little LG watching little Maximus from the side with Head Lady Noh). Another scene that I found a little bit annoying is when Luna stabbed JTE. Why JTE decided to confront Luna alone when she knows that Luna is dangerous and Eun Seop can easily be a back-up since he has been following Luna? Furthermore, there are a lot of advertisements. But, I gotta give thumbs up to the writer that she can weave them into the storyline. And now I'm still waiting for the last episode. I hope the writer is kind enough to give us a happy ending. At the very least, like she gave us the ending of Goblin. She was generous enough to give us an epilogue in the end of Goblin.<br/>\n",

Mystery after mystery, slowly unravelling each plot makes you more excited about the upcoming episodes. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching 'The King: Eternal Monarch'. Extremely excited to see next week’s episode and how it will be completed. I really hope the ending of this drama will make a justice to the entire story. Lots of love to the team of 'The King: Eternal Monarch' for creating such a unique storyline. Being a drama lover, I would have to say that it is really satisfying to watch a fresh piece of work, that doesn’t just involve romance but considers other genres, characters and their relationships to the right level.<br/>\n",

       " Compared to other k-dramas, this would fall on the \"heavy\" side, needing the viewer to give more than the usual attention to the dialogues, and watching the previous episodes is a must, to understand the progression of the story. Yet over-all, I would still rate it as one of the best I have ever seen. LMH is undoubtedly the best among the best of actors, and he carried the drama extremely well from beginning to end. Considering all the restrictions of having to film during the covid outbreak, the staff (director, script writer, etc) still managed to come up with a great project. To all of you, specially LMH, a big kudos and more power. To me, in a scale of 1-10, I would rate this a grand 11. To those who got \"lost\" while watching, I suggest to watch it again, to fully understand the story. Again, congratulations for a job well done. And LMH, you haven't lost anything at all. You have proven once again that you are not just a pretty face, but one of the best actors ever.<br/>\n",

She cries well is about the only thing I can say. I just find her bland and uninteresting. I find the chemistry between the two leads to be very forced and unnatural. I am a huge fan of Lee Min-Ho but even he is having a hard time saving this drama.

This drama definitely requires FOCUS and time to understand. For me, I love it, waiting every week, reading and making up possibly “theories”, fangirling + crying over spectacular scenes. I understand why some people don’t like it but it goes straight up to my top 3, after Goblin and DOTS. Once you start, don’t stop cause it just gets better and better!!

The trailer for the last episode is making me very nervous. I have not been this nervous about a final episode since Jane the Virgin and Crash Landing on You..... How about the king traveling through time to get back 2020.... just nerve wracking!!!!! I was like will it be years before he gets back to her.

If she was a gold digger, she would've been nice to him once she found out his jacket actually had diamond buttons. She started dating him when she found out he's king because she found out he wasn't crazy all along and you'll notice she starts to trust him 100% after that. Their relationship is mutual without the need to ask each other. He never asked her to date him, to marry him, or to be his queen. He just states these things as a matter of fact and she just goes along with it because she feels as a person he has decent and good characteristics.<br/>\n",

I also think they should of used Jung Eun Chae as her acting is great. She did a great job in Return and The Guest. I have invested to much time in this drama now to quit watching, but have wanted to a couple of times. I agree with everything SH commented on about this drama. Continue to enjoy all of you.<br/>\n",

       " The King: Eternal Monarch is a highly anticipated drama from last year. After I watched this drama I was very carried away by the cinematography which is very beautiful and the depiction of each episode is very detailed. This drama is very good-by connecting aspects of science, mathematics in a parallel world. This work deserves appreciation because of the imagination and thought that is far beyond the ordinary that would have been imagined before. Continue to do your best in this drama.<br/>\n",

       " One of the worst dramas starring A class celebs. I still remember the moment I was too excited and couldn't contain my joy just reading about the releasing date of this drama. Oh the plot, oh the dazzling stars, oh the fantasy genre which I always adore. But it left a bitter taste in my mouth the more I began to watch it. I can't help to compare it to The World of Marriage, which was airing at the same time slot, and now I just stop tuning into The King on Netflix. Utter disappointment, boring dragging plot with no climax, a waste of talented actors and actresses. This drama's product placement was severe. You'd think it's a 1 hour advertisement of people consecutively eating fried chicken, drinking The Alley boba milk tea, and smearing Laneige makeup. Nonetheless to say, I quit at 6th episode. And that was I really tried to go on, but couldn't.<br/>\n",

       " If a show needs twelve episodes to finally get interesting and pick up its pace, it cannot be the best drama of the season or the year or ever. As many have mentioned, the potential was there from the very start, but the pacing has always been problematic. Having a plot twist at the end of every episode, with the rest of it being very lacklustre, doesn’t qualify it to be a good drama. I get that many people have differing opinions about the chemistry between the leads, but truth be told, the scene stealers remain the supporting characters like WDH and the Prime Minister. LMH and KGE may have the star power as the leads, but think the writer has made their relationship overly convoluted and thus, too much of a soap opera.<br/>\n",

       " One of the best KDramas ever! I’ve been looking forward to Fridays &amp; Saturdays every week for this drama especially during this pandemic time where we all are mostly staying home. Love the imagination, direction &amp; amazing cast! I really enjoyed watching the main cast as well as the supporting casts! Amazing chemistry by the main cast, excellent story line and people who don’t like it may just be those who take the series too practically or lack imagination (sorry). My only complaint is, I can’t wait for the last few episodes!!!! I can’t stop thinking abt what will happen to the couple and who the mystery man was (I don’t believe it was the king himself because if it was, he would have saved his father too)! Amazing job team King!<br/>\n",

       " i've been watching TKEM since the beginning of the release, and i feel like the likeliness of the drama has gone through drastic highs and lows for me personally. the plot is amazing. it has so much potential, especially coming from the same screenwriter as goblin, descendants, mr. sunshine. etc. (she seriously has an amazing amount of skill!). but i say \"it has so much potential\" because it's a bit lacking for me. the romance felt so rushed, and i feel like the build up between taeul and gon is so vital to the structure of the plot...that it kind of just crumbles for me with how they poorly executed it. kim go eun's character is initially presented as standoffish and tough. it's presumable she's never even been in a relationship before. i love that kind of character who's responsible and focused on herself. it doesn't make sense that she goes from that to someone who is head over heals over the king in just one episode. where were the scenes where we saw her guard go down? no clips of subtle interactions that led to her falling in love with him? it just seems like she suddenly decided she was in love with him out of nowhere. their build up should've been much slower. i love every character individually, and like i said, amazing plot! but for me, the first few episodes really just killed it for me. now that were on episode 12 and there's only two more weeks left, the episodes have been beautifully presented in my opinion. episode 10-12 were lovely. i wished i felt the same energy in episodes 1-9 though...it just feels like wasted potential. :(<br/>\n",

I've been watching kdramas for a few years now and I have never been this excited or invested in a drama before.

This drama is litt. they play both of the characters and yess they rock it. great super great. especially the drama can be so cute and funny at the same time, love it from jo young and jo eun seob character. although it’s a bit thrill but they can bring some comedy and romance at the same time. and i think it will be a little bit melo drama too. what will happen with corea and seoul? can’t waittt.\n",

       " Love the show. Watched it on Netflix probably not at the allotted time slot because of time difference between Korea and NY, USA. Love all the characters especially the main cast. It’s an adult role for LMH and he’s doing a great job portraying ‘The King’. Kim Go-Eun is my favorite actress and she did great. Love her looks. I did watched it again twice and now I appreciated the drama more and I had a better understanding of what the story is all about. But then again, who doesn’t watch LMH shows twice or more just to see him? ? Don’t forget that I don’t speak or understand the Korean language. Even so, I love the storyline, their facial expressions and the exchanges between the characters. It seems like a lot of thought and a lot of work had been put into this show and I enjoyed it.

       " Am I the only one who wants a sad ending and lee lim to kill more people? I find a happy ending kind of unrealistic even though this drama is fantasy and there’s been too many hints that it’s a sad ending. If it’s a happy ending, that’s wonderful but I’m aiming for a sad ending if though LeeEul deserve happiness. Sometimes sad endings are meant to be and it’s good to have a good cry. I want Lee Lim to kill more people because I want to see more action going on. But yet again, there’s only 4 more episodes which makes me wonder how are they going to wrap up everything with so many unanswered questions and plot twists? I don’t think sbs will extended the episodes but could they perhaps extended the duration of the episodes? It’ll be better. I really enjoyed ep 11, I don’t know why it’s the lowest rating. Boy some of the other low rating episodes were kind of understandable but ep 11? Jeez what was south career even watching. I personally liked ep 11 and ep 12 very much. I know some people are not fond of LMH and KGE chemistry on screen but to me in ep 12, their chemistry was overflowing. I loved the kiss but why did the zoom out. Bruh like what were the camera directors thinking. Next time close up kiss and more scandalous ?. I can’t believe there’s only 2 more weeks left, it’s been a wild journey.<br/>\n",

For those who are still confused about Kang Sin Jae. During the time that Tae Eul met him in Kingdom of Corea, it was just for a moment and a different world. He was not in KoC but he's in Republic of Korea bcs you can see the difference on the road side. So don't get confused. Actually all the past episodes was in the year 2019 and in ep10 they were in 2020. Both worlds are still in the same year but different capital city, different emperor, different government and all.

There are moments when it drags a little (even with all the wonderful details), and I have found myself thinking, \"Do they not have enough material?\", but otherwise, I am always anxious for the next episode - which to me is a very positive sign.

       " Where to start?\n",
       " </p><p>I was really excited before the show aired, I loved the sneak peeks and trailers. Knowing the cast, the writer and seeing parts of the story made me all hyped up.\n",
       " </p><p>Then I started watching, if we look solely at the storyline, let’s be honest. It’s a gem, you can do so much with 2 worlds, people who look exactly the same as you, love that expands 2 worlds. But then the story started to unfold, my oh my, I’m dissatisfied. The first episode was perfect, an introduction. From the second episode the writer should’ve started to incorporate little things that would build up to the love arc. The love arc was too forced, which makes it less believable, hence why so many people say that can’t see the chemistry. Because it’s there, but for us viewers chemistry needs to have a foundation. Little things that draw us in and makes us want them to be together.\n",
       " </p><p>Because there are two worlds, we get introduced to many characters. The ones that live in our world and the people who live in the kingdom, each of them has a story and the drama tries to at least show us how the villain is replacing people. But it’s too much, too many characters and storylines. Which leaves less time to make us get invested in the main cast and their character development. The constant off editing doesn’t make it any better.\n",
       " </p><p>The drama as a puzzle is ok, I found a lot of easter eggs and I’m watching the show to see the ending unfold.\n",
       " </p><p>But I would like to take a moment and talk about Woo Do Hwan, what a talent. His acting is off the charts and I can’t get enough of him. The way he makes it totally believable that there are really 2 people with the same face but totally different characters. I’m loving every scene he’s in and he’s the reason i look forward to new episodes. He’s the one carrying the show, at least for me. I hope I haven’t offended anybody. This is my honest review. Please don’t question my intellect, because I get the story and the complicated plots and twists. I just think it’s poorly written and executed.<br/>\n",

       " This drama is still inside my cup of tea. I love the cinematography (though I hate the unsubtle products placements). The writer has had her hits, but actually this one is a lil bit of a miss. It could have been better had it been directed by another director. Yes to the comment re Goblin director. I personally still love watching it, but I get it why the ratings are not as expected. Each episode doesn’t have its own mini mystery to solve, not enough cliffhanger. It definitely doesn’t have enough oomph for a fantasy drama, almost too vanilla. Though I have to disagree with comments about the lacking main leads chemistry. I think they definitely have good chemistry, but it’s not oozing because of the way their storyline and characters are written. It’s a different kind of romance. I love it cause it feels realistic. A mature relationship between a king and a police officer, no push and pull. And Woo Do Hwan is just adorable in this drama! Would love to see more of Young and Eun Sup with Na Ri and Seung A. I will keep watching to the end. Despite everything, I’m still pulled into these two worlds.<br/>\n",

       " I loved ep 9 and 10. Ep 10 definitely did not have obvious PPL and I hope the next remaining episodes continues to do that. I believe that lee minho and Kim Goeun do have chemistry, maybe it isn’t the strong, however, I definitely know they have chemistry of screen from the behind the scenes. I’m really can’t wait for the next episode because of the preview. They can’t just leave us hanging like that. After reading some theories on twitter, I believe that it is Lee Gon’s future self who was kissing Taeeul at the end. He was wearing the same outfit we saw in ep 1: The words he was saying seemed a bit off and was kind of hinting something. Jung taeeul also stepped back when he met lee gon which makes me wonder why. Is it just me but I want Lee Lim to kill more people. Obviously not the main cast but other people because I want to see more action. I do think today’s episode did not flow smoothly. We had to go into about 20 minutes where we left off from ep 9. I think the beginning scenes could of been remove. Also, I’m sure the timelines were different because there were many cuts but it was not displayed. Overall I really enjoyed ep 9 and 10 were the best episodes. Really can’t wait for ep 11<br/>\n",

And Since the first eps i start to compares this drama with Goblin, ii really loved goblin, the cinematography was superb, both if the drama has superb cinematography, but i just annoyed by the characters of FL on goblin, but i still can feels the romance between the ML and FL on goblin, at least the romance between the two are well developed, not perfect but i can understand and following their developing feelings for each other, and we know from the start the FL is the destined bride for ML. On the other hand, for The King, i can’t, the FL is less annoying than FL on goblin, really KGE characters as police woman on this drama is much way better cause the FL is strong, independent, and smart. But like other people says about the chemistry, the sudden “I Love You” what the f? How come you suddenly loved someone when on the previous eps the FL didn’t show any sparks of being fallin i love to the ML, even when ML kissed the FL, she barely show any feeling of love, come on, if she is a stright forward person why dont you make a better story telling for both of them to develops natural Love story, cause when i saw the scene FL said I Love You, the so many questions that crossed my mind : Am i missing some scene? How come she said I Love You with that straight face? Why you started to fall in love to the man who stalks you with no identity and seems crazy (cause he said he is the king from other world), and suddenly you fallen in love? Cause now you know he is the real king from another dimensions? I think what make it feels forces is because as long as I watched every episode both of them are barely talked deeply about each other as a couple, even the ML whose longing to meet FL is need more time to ensure his feeling for her, feels like they don’t know each other deeply to said love to each other, they dont have much time as a couple, they are from different world, so the writer and director should know better that they need a Good Romance story line to intertwined their fate as a couple<br/>\n",

       " Maybe because I can relate to the FL a lot so I don't feel like their romance doesn't make sense. In fact my bf told me, I'm like JTE. I was the one who confessed to him. I don't show much \"love\" as people would expect. I'm not mushy or lovey dovey. He's the one who does all that and that's fine. There are different kinds of love stories and I guess because LG and JTE's love story aren't the stereotypical one, people want to demean it. Her confession did seemed rush and that's because it was meant to be rushed. She knew they don't have much time left together so in order to spend the limited time they have together, she's rushing it. She confessed because she's already forseeing the short-lived relationship they'll have together and decided to accept living and loving with each other in the moment.<br/>\n",

       " oh man, the ratings really dropped. ep 9 the lowest rating out of all episodes. I don't understand. It's getting more exciting and more is being revealed.

I guess there are a lot of flaws in this drama and that everyone has different preferences, but I sincerely hope ratings can go up.

       " I have a lot to say about this drama. I was really anticipating but I don’t think it has reached to my level of expectations. I’m still enjoying it but it’s not like a WOW drama. The actors are portraying their characters very well. Woo Dohwan, especially, is slaying his dual roles. I can’t believe it’s the same person playing eunseop and joyeong. Sorry but eunseop &gt;&gt;&gt; joyeong. I hope neither of them dies. The cinematography is out of this world, so so beautiful. One of the best cinematography in the kdrama world. The thing I like the most about this drama is the storyline. The storyline is so interesting and hasn’t been done before and I can’t wait to find out more about Lee Lim’s ambition and how Lee Gon will defeat him. Oh, and the theories. There are so many theories and I love reading them. Everyone are like detectives lol. However, there are some aspects about this drama which I wish can improve on. The romance is very bland. Sorry but you have to admit the truth. Even if you’re fans of both of the leads, you can immediately tell that the romance writing is lacking. I personally think there wasn’t enough romance build up between taeeul and lee gon. I’m head over heals with this pair but I understand why viewers are frustrated and confused on how taeeul fell for Lee gon, details were missing. Lee minho and Kim goeun have better chemistry off screen than on screen lol. I still love their romance moments though. One thing for sure that I know everyone is annoyed about is the amount of PPL. I know that every drama there’s PPL but TKEM’s PPL are too obvious. The cringy lines with it is so bad. The production crew can at least try to blend it more well and not make it so obvious. It feels like a commercial drama. Last con, the plot is too slow. There’s only three more weeks left until the drama ends and I don’t even know how they’re going to wrap this up smoothly. The action has only begun now and that’s more than half of the drama. The drama focused way too less on the main objective. Also, there are many secrets being revealed but it also feels like we know nothing at all. They’re saying so much but also nothing at the same time. I hope they don’t cram everything at the end. Nonetheless, I enjoy this drama. It’s my first ongoing kdrama that I’m watching from the very start and I’m always looking forward for the next episodes. I’m on twitter daily, scrolling and reading theories lol. I’m 70% sure it will have a sad ending. The amount of foreshadowing points it out. But you know, sometimes sad endings are meant to be and it’s good to have a cry sometimes. Anyways, I just really hope the ratings will go up soon. I hate how the Korean media always have something bad to say about this drama every week. It’s like someone is purposely trying to drag TKEM down. Please just stop. Looking forward towards the next episode:)<br/>\n",

       " This drama had a slow transition. For me, 1-6 episodes was a little bit dragging. Episode 8 is where the real action starts. But you cannot skip a single episode at the beginning because you will not understand the flow of the story. I love the ending of episode 8 and this is the reason why I couldn’t wait for episode 9. There are unnecessary scenes during the first half of this drama. I still do think that they could have done a better storytelling between Gon and Taeul’s affection for each other. But that is just one part of the story. Episode 9, their chemistry is finally showing. You just have to put aside the weird “love story” in the beginning. Now, there is definitely more action. The cinematography of this drama is fantastic! I’m not very fond of their songs, nothing really catchy for me but it worked out for most of the scenes. Everyone is doing a great job putting out their best acts. LMH might appear to be stoic in this drama but his subtle expressions and his overall aura just fits the role of a king. His deep voice can go from flat, to soft to fierce. I love it that his role is intelligent and fierce yet in front of Taeul and the old lady in the palace, he becomes soft. In episode 9, LMH’s acting really stood out. I can now truly, truly say that this is an amazing drama! This show is a good one and probably one of the most interesting dramas I have ever watched. The dark side of this story is what really pulls me. You become so immersed to it because it makes you think. Some people don’t like it but as long as I like it, who cares about opinions. Koreans should be proud that they have talented people who can bring out an awesome project like this one. I think it is underrated and it just doesn’t make sense to me. All the actors in this drama were so on point. I hope they get plenty of rewards. Kudos!<br/>\n",

       " So glad that so many of the recent comments point out the deficiencies of this drama, rather than just blindly fangirling over the leads or gushing over the non-existing chemistry between the leads. I really wanted to like this drama a lot because I enjoy a good sci fi series once in a while, and the premise of the parallel worlds looked really interesting. However the writers seemed to be dragging out the drama on purpose. By the time it reached ep 5 and that weird kiss thing happened, I stopped watching. From the latest comments, it looked as if the female lead’s confession also didn’t make sense to some viewers. I don’t doubt that the leads have huge fan bases, but even in the few eps that I watched, I found the supporting actors more intriguing. I may come back to this later if the pace and storyline improve, but it’s definitely not because of the painfully dreary love story between the leads.<br/>\n",

       " The plot was very confusing during the first 4 episodes. I had to repeat those episodes few times in order for me to understand where the flow of the story is going. I agree that there are just too many cheesy lines, I am not excited with the love story but more on the mystery of this drama. LMH is just given a script to act on. His acting goes well with him being a king. He is not supposed to act like a clown. He is supposed to be more serious, intelligent and very much well educated. That was the character that he is supposed to play. I agree as well that his character here is a bit bland but I don’t think he is a bad actor. He is not the best actor but to say that he is horrible with his acting is just not right. It’s difficult to compare all their acts in this drama because they are all given different roles to play. I think they all did their parts well. As for the romance, I cannot understand this love story at all. The FL doesn’t seem to show that she fell in love with him. If she did, I cannot find it in any of the episodes that’s already out. I guess I am just not feeling the love story of the lead couple. There’s no building up. It feels like out of nowhere, there comes love that only the actors of the drama, the director and scriptwriter can understand. This is what’s missing from this drama. I don’t blame the actors. I blame it more on how it was written. This parallel world concept may not appeal to many people but for me, it is quite interesting. I love the mystery of this drama and it is quite unique. You will get confused the first time you watch it and that’s why paying attention to each character, each event is very important when you watch this drama. 8 episodes out already and now I can see how it will turn around. It may not have the best ratings but it is not a bad drama. You just need patience and pay attention with their lines, events and people in order for you not to get lost. Don’t be too harsh on the actors of this drama. I am sure they are doing their best to bring out the characters to life. No matter how famous they are, they do get hurt. Your harsh words are like stones being thrown at them and they didn’t do anything bad to you. All they did was to act and bring entertainment.<br/>\n",

       " Same stoic LMH face, anyway what else to expect from him? I think the side actors are doing much better especially WDH and KKN. Their stories and acting are extremely better than the male lead. The back story of SJ's much more interesting and something to look forward to. WDH's double role is outstanding, he's a show stealer here. The romance isn't there or maybe because the writer thinks that it'll make our heart flutter even before establishing the main lead's loveline, but no at least not for me. The cheesy lines are for fangirls only, nothing more. The confessions of both leads was like reciting an English poem in front of the class, it feels cringey rather than cute. Bromance isn't reaching my liking as well, it's funny that I see bromance between Jo Eun Seob and Jo Yeong more. Watching this only for WDH and KKN.\n",

It makes me sad to see that years of history were destroyed and Korea had been split into two. I also heard that the north has a lot of natural resources that S. Korea now has to have imported from other countries which is also a bummer. This drama is good though. I love how the story is flowing and how it gives you just enough to be satisfied until the next episode while keeping enough to itself so you continue to watch to figure out what will happen and who will win.

       " And @C. It doesn't have to always be that way, i mean the “I love you”, that u must feel something, it should be sudden and unexpected sometimes as in this drama. I love the way they didn't drag it out, her affection towards Lee Gon, I mean, in some dramas, there will come a scene that u would already knw that the “I love you” is gonna come, after all the play hard to get. In this case she has been thinking about it for a while and she just has to let it out as there are better things to do going forward in the movie like eliminating the enemies and closing the gate between the parallel worlds. So I think it's better to pronounce the love earlier and not get the useless thoughts of when to tell him confusing her head, and focus on both of 'em joinin forces to overcome the obstacles.

I don't get why the King was so smitten with her when he first saw her. I mean yes he does know her for 24 years but not as a love interest. The ID was just the nearest connection he has for his savior and that's that. However, the way it was written makes it looks like he loves her all his life. The romance scene was so abrupt.

       " Hello~ First of all, I am not LMH and KGE's fan but I really love this drama because of its story about two parallel worlds. I love science fiction :) Although it will give me headache sometimes when I am looking for \"the red thread\" of the story. But, if you success to find it, I think you would also love this drama like I am. Good job for the Writer-nim. I love romance scene which is brought very natural by two main actors in this drama. And for the surprise in episode 8, it's really make a goosebumps for me because.... I make a guess from ep 1 that Kang Shin Jae isn't from Republic of Korea because he knew the logo.

       " Ok. 1. First of, The reason why a lot of people find this drama boring, is because there is no endgame in sight, we cant connect with the characters because they’re written in such a dry manner. No one seems to have a personality (the only interesting take at the moment is the body gaurd and his doppelgänger). There is no build up towards a romantic relationship and there’s no real connection between the two main characters. It literally came out of nowhere and didn’t make any sense. The female lead is a spectacular actress, but she’s unemotional throughout and because lee min ho’s character is reserved, it just doesn’t balance each other out. She hasn’t expressed ANY believable feelings for him. They could literally just be friends. They didn’t do anything together to solidify that this was going in a romantic direction and they both ended up being dry. So you can’t feel anything deep between the two. As for the story? Because they want to DRAG this mysterious role that the villain is playing, It ends up making watchers lose interest. They’ve literally been dragging his goal for like 8 episodes straight. We watch and then realize what he’s up to. We can’t feel who these characters are because we haven’t been given any emotions or memories/ flashbacks: encounters to make us feel for them. So we know WHO they are, or how they were before. Besides the body gaurd and the prime minister, everyone else is just bland.<br/>\n",

But in the republican. of korea, lee gin read somewhere that one of the king died so that’s why the two universe are so different but if the king died in the republic that means that he didn’t have any descendants right? Or is children would have taken his place? so that means that lee gon’s parent shouldn’t have been born in the republic and neither would have lee gon. I don’t know that much about korean history but did the king who died have children or not? maybe the two parallel universe also don’t connect with history so idk<br/>\n",

Tbh the drama is good, quite confusing at the early episode buttt if u patient, u can understand the plot i think. The problem is maybe from editing. there are still many scenes that lack of background music. for example, there is one funny scene in ep 5, but bcuz there are no bgm, its just feel flat...like serious scene. The CGI i think they can do more from that. I hope the director can evaluate the previous episodes and fix them.

       " The first few episodes of the drama didn't really piqued my interest. I decided to continue with this because of the writer. What I also think that saved this show were Jang Eun Chae and Kim Kyung Nam. I love how they portray their characters so well, especially Jang Eun Chae. She's a strong-willed woman leading a whole country, and I am freaking impressed with that. Kim Kyung Nam's acting skills are on another level. You can really see emotions in his eyes. I am hoping that I get to see more of them as the drama progresses.<br/>\n",

       " My first time to comment on k-dramas - the new normal that covid19 made me of ? 1) The screenwriter has proven her worth with her famous works which are distinct from one another. And the satisfaction it gave to viewers remain. TKEM challenges the IQ and EQ of likers, lurkers, and haters. And that made the story more interesting. Lead cast openly expressed their initial confusion but after reading the entire script they liked the original concept of a fictional parallel world (RK and fictional KC) and the unique dual characters they need to work on 2) The portrayal of actors/actresses varies on the personality/background of the character they are assigned to. Lee Gon is a mathematician (stigma: serious, scientific, assertive, theory based, above all geek, not much of the demonstrative type) before he became the king. LMH is able to muster and deliver the opposing attributes of his character. Jeong Tae-eul is motherless at 5y.o., a street smart kid who decided to become brave that's why she became a detective. She is straightforward, no-nonsense, with issues on showing her femininity or the lady in her. And yes, KGE delivered it well! As for the rest of the cast, a big round of applause to all of them!!! They've been doing great!!! 3) On chemistry of LMH and KGE? we hv subjective / personal biases on this .... but the behind the scenes and interviews expressly and impliedly showed the degree of chemistry they've developed. So it's a thumbs up! 4) for the CGI, i dont have issues on it coz im after the essence of the scene and 5) As for the rating, I am confident the succeeding episodes will draw in attention with heightened mystery, shared loved (70% of LeeGon's mind is.occupied by Jeong Tae-eul), action and unexpected turn of events (wch screenwriter Kim Eun-soo is known for).<br/>\n",

       " I agree with those here that say how interesting the concept is but the execution is either boring or confusing. In medical dramas, even if they spew all those terms i do not understand, it's fine by me. But here, nope, just have to skip those math stuff. Maybe because the med terms in the dramas help move the story forward but the math terms here looks like they're used simply to rub the fact that yes, the king is a mathematician and yes, this is a scifi/fantasy drama. Even the story telling is slow. Hope the upcoming episodes are better. I really have expectations for this show.<br/>\n",

       " It reminds me of vanessa hudgens’ movie... lol. But i mean yeah, the story is interesting. Some parts feel slow. LMH’s acting is idk, its kinda boring as usual. I agree with the comment below that he puts me to sleep too lol. No offense. He’s just hot, that’s all. I like Woo do hwan/Joyoung’s character and acting more, serious in another world and funny or playful in another world. Loved his accent too. So far, i like kim go eun’s character here too, better than Goblin. The show also feels like another Goblin show, but i find this more interesting than Goblin (i dropped that one). It’s a little bit confusing at some parts, but bearable. I just skip the science part or math coz i have no idea what theyre talking about. Anyways, i’m probably gonna keep on watching. It’s definitely not the best show, but it looks like a high budget show, and the cinematography is good. The casts are popular but not the best actors in my opinion. That is probably why they got high ratings. Story is interesting though a little confusing and slow, and sometimes boring and doesnt make sense. But i like guns and im hoping for some action, and I like the OSTs, so 50/50 i might end up finishing this or not.<br/>\n",

       " For those saying its cheesy, i disagree. I would say that kdramas usually have one particular plot and thats what boxes them off. I wont lie i wish there were more steamy moments but i guess thats not their thing. I got to like Lee Min after i saw him in Heirs/Inheritors. I like his style, his assertiveness and aggression at times. He commands. There are some moments where i think but that doesnt make sense or thats so obvious. Also was thinking why the girl didnt show pics of her friend from the cafe in her world to the look alike in his world. Lol. But i am eagerly awaiting the next episodes.

In other dramas they spend like half of the episodes overall watching then see some chemistry building or story but to this... I can't get it... If u really hate it n are bored why not watch some other drama.... Or u can name it to others.... They should also know... And compare it with that.... It's unique in it's own way.... Just give some time more then complain.... Or just watch TWOM.... It's a great drama but totally different... So don't compare with that but with the one with same genres....<br/>\n",

The cinematography , acting of the actors and overall, the plot has really caught my attention. Although confusing in the first 3 episodes, episode 4 has really proven to me that I should keep watching and supporting this drama. Towards the ending of the episode, we can see the development in not only the story, but the relationship between the 2 main characters (watch it for yourself if curious ;)). So, if you are unsure to watch it or not due to the ratings, I suggest that you give this drama a try. As I said before, the first few episodes are slow-paced, but trust me, it gets better.\n",

       " Watched the first two episodes and was totally entranced. There's always something to look for in every scene: a clue, the majestic backgrounds, and the beautiful faces of the cast (especially Lee Minho's because he is extremely pleasing to look at). I rewatched the first two episodes at least three times and I was glad I did because I made some theories about certain scenes that I missed. Also, there are little details in Lee Minho's and Woo Dohwan's acting that I missed and it gave me butterflies when I caught them (Lee Minho's smirks, and Woo Dohwan's eyebrow twitch and steely gaze). This week's episodes (3-4) have been quite exciting because we are finally getting to the action of the plot that requires the characters to constantly interact with each other (especially Lee Minho's and Kim Goeun's characters because I love the two of them together so much- they have a different dynamic that leaves me hilariously feeling bad for Lee Minho's character). I really can't wait for episodes 5-6 because whew.. for a person who only has four episodes of Lee Minho's incredibly handsome face, it's really not enough. And also, I want to see how the plot unfolds with the first (hopefully not because he has an important piece of information) death of a major/minor character ;).<br/>\n",

       " people keep talking about how these first episodes don't make sense or they're confusing and its because they aren't meant to. think about the first episodes of goblin too, they didn't make much sense because the story was still developing through the new episodes that were coming out. stop complaining and just watch the show all the way till the end until it finishes then that is when people can truly review the drama but for now lets just enjoy it and hope we don't get a sad ending. also after watching mr sunshine which was also written by kim eun-sook i can definitely tell you that it is impossible to be disappointed by any of her work.<br/>\n",

       " Okay, when I go back to watch episodes 1 and 2, I realize that there is a huge deal to putting music behind dialogues! For example, when the characters have conversations that are suppose to be funny or when they are joking around, there is no background music to support the lightheartedness of the scene, so it ends up being either very awkward for the audience or we have to read the subtitles again to get that they were joking. It feels so stiff without the little background music like there's not enough emotion to support the scene. The only parts where they put the background music is at the end of the drama. This is the only difference between the production of The King and Goblin or Mr. Sunshine.<br/>\n",

       " The only thing good about this kdrama so far (after two episodes) are the actors, but even they can't pull of this terrible script. There was a huge hype and expectations for this drama but its actually so boring. The pacing is very strange, and there is little that makes the audiences actually care about these characters. The idea is really interesting and had huge potential, but the execution has been terrible. Having cliches isn't inherently bad, and they can work really well for some dramas, but this entire drama is a boring cliche. I know there's this whole narrative that we should all just sit tight and hope for better episodes to come, but if the drama doesn't gattract you in you the first episods then it's not worth eatching<br/>\n",

       " First of all, I wanted to praise this drama in its overall aspect. Oh My God, this is so amazing. And it is mind-blowing. I really missed the fast-paced direction of kim-eun Suk's drama. I am talking about the directing here. As we noticed, DOTS has a fast-paced direction, while Goblin and Mr. Sunshine have more deep and slow-paced direction. In this drama, fast, fun and smooth pacing is combined with deep and dramatic directing elements, which makes this film so beautiful. The angles are beautifully and expressively captured on slow parts at the same time, there are smooth and sharp action on its fast parts.\n",
       " </p><p>Now let's talk about the story. It was refreshing for me and I was on the edge of my seat watching how the story goes. Honestly, I have so many theories when it comes to time-space bending and multiverse. My mind actually wanders a lot when I see many mathematical equations and amazingly, I can see these in this drama. Mathematical equations being shown here might have a much deeper significance in its plot.\n",
       " </p><p>The location of the scar of Lee Gon not making sense might somehow have a much deeper explanation. I am even confused with the time relations, As we can see some characters appearing in a specific time, when it is impossible. The female lead appears to save the young Lee gon from his uncle. But how is it possible? Could it be a foreshadowing of the future events that the female lead might encounter as the drama progresses? My God, help me uncover this.<br/>\n",

       " Am I the only one kind of disappointed in the lead actress? Kim Go-Eun is an AMAZING actress, but I was hoping that Park Shin Hye would be the leading actress alongside Lee Min Ho. The reason is because Descendants of the Sun, Goblin, and Mr. Sunshine are all connected to each other, and they are also all amazing, so I was hoping for this story to be Park Shin Hye x Lee Min Ho, since they were in The Heirs together.\n",
       " </p><p>They would have been a part of the connection between the 3 recent Kim Eun Sook dramas, and Park Shin Hye and Lee Min Ho would have been given a second chance at having a Kim Eun Sook drama that would have actually had quality writing compared to The Heirs. We could have had them love each other in another life, which would have been amazing.\n",
       " </p><p>Then I was hoping Kim Eun Sook would get the 2 leads from A Gentleman's Dignity and give them a better drama and also connect it to the other 3. I feel like it was a missed opportunity to not give the leading actress role to Park Shin Hye.\n",
       " </p><p>But the director did change so I guess those 3 will be independent from the rest of Kim Eun Sook's future dramas unless they collaborate again.\n",
       " </p><p>Still, I'm just so disappointed that Park Shin Hye wasn't the leading actress and instead Kim Go-Eun.\n",
       " </p><p>But maybe this is a one-off deal, and her next story will connect to her previous 3 dramas and add on to that. Maybe Lee Min Ho will get another Kim Eun Sook drama with Park Shin Hye, and maybe it will be of quality content. This drama does sound a bit unrealistic. I know Goblin was unrealistic in its own ways, but it was also realistic in its own ways. This drama just sounds like a fantasy story however, so maybe it is just a one-off.<br/>\n",

       " For some reason i feel like the writer is establishing herself as a fantasy-based screenwriter. I really like Goblin so i'm sure as hell on board with this. I see it as a redemption that this screenwriter made for having LMH to star in the so generic boring Heirs drama a few years back by offering him this epic piece (i hope it's going to be epic tho!). Honestly speaking i'm a little confused with the plot tho. So in this drama, is LMH going to be playing dual roles (bromance involving dual roles??? that's something new lol) or is the Korean Emperor version of LMH's character would be taking over LMH's present day character carrying out what the other version of his has to do while at the same time taking care of his own business? Seems like i'm gonna have to wait for more updates on this drama. Whoever the leading actress i don't mind but i hope it is not an actress who cannot act all that much and ruins what possibly could affect the best traits of the leading actress, popular actress or not is not even something that really matters as long as it's good.<br/>\n",

I watched Lee Min Ho's series before, he was okey back then. but in TKEM I feel that he matured alot,you can feel the intense emotions from his eyes, facial expression and the tone of his voice.I love Kim Go Eun from Goblin she is an effective actress you can feel her pain, longing, sadness. I think their chemistry is really good. TKEM is not the usual Kdrama. It is worth it... I'll be shipping Kim Go Eun and Lee Min Ho forever they look good together.

But perhaps it's a bit objective that people got bored with it. I liked the ending, although for some reason couldnt get on with feeling bored. I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on. Is it the dialogues, always the way they talk like riddles. I've lost interest and sometimes couldnt get on what's going on. I'm not sure about any international success it has, but I couldnt enjoy it really much for some reason. I had to watch this, i dont feel like i wasted time. I liked some stories, some things were really emotional. But just not that good. I'd totally prefer Secret Garden over it. It was amazing. Why? I guess screenwriting, directing and all other things really matter and no matter if the story is complex, mysterious or good, without all other elements it doesnt work. I don't think I'll rewatch this.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nKDlover Jun 25 2020 2:52 am \\nThis drama is the definition of perfection. It reminded me Fringe and amazed me. God bless you Kim Eun Sook for writing this masterpiece. Your dramas are always the best. I must also say that Kim Go Eun's performance is remarkable as usual, you can see everything in her eyes. She is an adorable actress.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAlexey Jun 24 2020 7:05 pm \\nSo, I'm not sure which fault is that. Plot is actually pretty interesting, and script too. It couldve been one of the best dramas in 2020... But there were something wrong with everything else. I'll list you all things what I believe went wrong.\\nDirecting and editing:\\nThe drama was very slow, but the pacing is never a problem. I hate comparing, but I cannot avoid to do so with Goblin. It had slow pacing in a lot of moments, but the directing and screenwriting made it all very good, very balanced and harmonic. Same goes to something like CLOY. Soundtrack, OSTs fitted and everything worked perfectly. Fast pacing never makes a series or a drama a better thing as itself, but the directing and editing does. And this flopped here. There were so much of unnecessary things that could be avoided and fast-paced. During the episode 6, which is a pinnacle of boredom in the show, the battle with Japanese ships I cringed and laughed my ass off for all the unnecessary filling and stuff that has been happening there. I were numb when I suddenly bursted out with laughter. They tried to make this so epic with all these camera angles and epic faces of Lee Min Ho and Woo Do Hwan that I laughed so hard I nearly shat my pants. Sorry guys. Same with the scene where cops chasing suspects... in the very same time of episode. It was shown the most boring way it could've been. It didnt work. And there were a lot of these things. Sometimes my interest woke up, but then it disappeared, and then again and again.\\nCharacters:\\nThe characters were greatly written (not all tho, I still couldnt understand necessarity of Prime Minister and all her scenes in first half of the show) but again, directing made them boring. I were trying to think why and how this show bores me. It just couldnt have made me hooked. The only moments I remember I didnt feel bored was when Eun Sup showed up on screen, when someone died or when Lee Gon went mad on killing everyone. Everything else - sometimes I really had to force myself on looking on screen. I hate to say this, but this ain't good.\\nChemistry:\\nBetween main leads - I dont know. Feelings of Jeong Tae-Eul came out of nowhere really. She cries at some points and it doesnt work for her character and for me, or at least they didnt show how it should've been. And Lee Min Ho - his potential was realised only somewhere near the end of the show, but before I was bored looking at his numb face and idle poses they've been practicing a lot.\\nStorytelling:\\nIts very messy. Why so many unnecessary characters, stories. At some point I've stopped understanding what's going on and had to rethink how certain things are affecting anyone in the series. Oh and there were little accents on moments where there should have been. It was messy as I said earlier. I couldnt remember a lot of names because of that, and lost my interest almost to everyone except main characters (because I was interested what's gonna happen next; I lost my sympathy and enjoyment somewhere in first episodes). The music were just for the background, wasnt fitting in a lot of moments. Sometimes it was so epic I cringed. OSTs were very actually very good tho. When they started to play, I became a bit alive.\\nEvery episode, I swear, I was trying to look at from zero, without prejudice. And guess what - I could handle to watch only first few minutes with enjoyment, but the other hour is me being bored but forcing myself to watch because I'm interested in the thing itself and hoping for better episodes.\\nThe show has so much of flaws that its gonna take a while to proceed them all. Apparently, this is going to be example that good investment, characters and story can be ruined by poor directing, editing and storytelling. This is going to be example how you shouldn't make a show.\\nPeople shouldn't suggest that it flopped because of advertisements. If the show was good enough, it wouldnt matter, even tho there were too much of ads and it was too direct that I couldnt help but cringe. But the show itself wasnt as good. I liked it somewhere, enjoyed it a bit. It gave some goosebumps but I just felt something isnt really right. The last like 6-7 episodes were a lot better than first ones, but still sometimes it was boring. And the drama could've been very good, but it turned out this. You should try watch it for yourself, but I dont think I would do it again. I'm kind of tired of it. I'm in the middle of 15th episode and I'm sleepy.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nScid Jun 23 2020 11:26 pm \\nI loved this story. It is exceptionally well written, directed and acted. And it would have been perfect, except for the ending. I think it suffers from a problem that is endemic in modern storytelling and betrays a problem in modern thought. It seems that these days it is considered smart to get a college education and settle in a job before you get serious about relationships. To my mind, this story points out the flaw in that way of thinking. As so many stories do, it starts with two people with fully developed lives in different worlds. By that I mean they each has an education, job, family, and relationships they have strived their whole life to make for themselves. This presents a problem for a romantic story, because one of them will ultimately have to give up their world to be with the other. While this story does as brilliant a job as can be done in working with that problem, it is one that is never satisfyingly resolved even to the very last frame. Ultimately we are left feeling that each one puts more value on their job than they do on the person they are supposedly desperate to be with.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\nLisa Jun 20 2020 6:32 pm \\nSPOILER\\nAbout the scar, what a bummer. They made such a big deal out of it then I felt like they dropped the ball on it. Ok, here\\'s some more thoughts ...\\nYo-Yo Boy (Aka: the spirit of the Manpasikjeok)\\nHe is basically the gate keeper and controls access to all the parallel worlds. He has the ability to appear in any physical form (young or older) and moves between worlds at will. Whichever physical form he appears in is probably dependent on what he needs to accomplish.\\nThe Yo-Yo I\\'m surprise no one has mentioned the yo-yo and what is its purpose. Here\\'s my 2 cents on this topic. Basically, the yo-yo represents the parallel worlds. You always see the boy constantly moving the yo-yo. This is symbolic of him doing his basic function which is to keep the parallel worlds in perpetual motion and in balance. Think of each of the two discs of the yo-yo as parallel world opposites separated from each other by a string and Yo-Yo boy is there to ensure all worlds are in balance and working the way they should be.\\nWhen the Manpasikjeok was broken in half, it took some of the control of the worlds out of yo-yo boy\\'s hands and into the hands of whoever has the Manpasikjeok pieces. Lee Lim\\'s activities were basically causing the entire yo-yo to be out of balance. The Corea side of the yo-yo was heavy with activities. If that keeps up, the yo yo will not work right to the point where it will be noticeable. Hence the bleed throughs into both Corea/Korea such as people in both worlds experiencing flashes of their dopplegangers. Ultimately, if nothing is done to correct the imbalance, the yo-yo will actually stop working. This was already well on its way; the more the Corea citizens affect changes in Korea, the longer time freezes. Ultimately, all parallel worlds would come to a stand still at some point (AKA time freezes forever and so is life as we know it).\\nIn order to restore balance, Yo-Yo boy needed a force to counter the Lee Lim force that caused the imbalance. This force, however, can not come from the Kingdom of Corea because that is where the driving force that messed things up came from - Lee Lim. The driving force to restore balance must come from the Republic of Korea to balance things out. Just imagine you and I having an arm wrestling contest. If I am winning and I\\'m able to pull your arm past the midpoint toward my side, the only way that balance can be restored is if you exert enough force to bring yourself back to the midpoint. Now apply this same concept to Corea/Korea with me being Corea and you being Korea.\\nA perfect example of why the Corea side can not restore the balance is in Episode 14. When both Lee Lim & the King were inside the place between-zero-and-one at the same time, it made the Manpasikjeok \"whole\" again. They both had an equal chance to change events that night but things still didn\\'t turn out the way they wanted. The 2020 Lee Lim got killed by the 1994 Lee Lim and the King didn\\'t make much of a change to his past situation. Their efforts did not work because the driving force and catalyst to fix both worlds must come from Korea - the other half of the yo-yo.\\nYo-Yo boy choose Tae-Eul to be that force to provide the equal and opposite reaction to put things in motion and back into balance. Why? Because she is the exact opposite of what Lee Lim stands for, she wants the worlds to be balanced AND she has the courage to pull it off. That was her fate. I think symbolically, she is the red string on the yo-yo. I googled it and this actually exists! \"The Red Thread of Fate is an East Asian belief originating from Chinese mythology. It is commonly thought of as an invisible red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are \"their true love\". ...The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. \"\\nIn the last episode, the yo-yo boy & teenage boy were shown as flashbacks in Tae-Eul\\'s life to conveyed that he has been keeping an eye on Tae-Eul all along. If you need more proof of Tae-Eul\\'s fate, rewatch the order of things in the last episode.\\nHer first successful shot went off which represented the force that was needed to get the yo yo going again and the 2 worlds back on track. You know everything is back on track because immediately right after the successful shot:\\n\\n-  The lily plant begins to grow the green shoot.  (Proof that time no longer freezes)\\n\\n- There is now wind in the place between-zero-and-one. You can see the wind because her hair was blowing.\\n- In the King\\'s between-zero-and-one place, all the red balloons and other stuff are now moving in the air.\\n- Lee Lim\\'s body disintegrated in the between-zero-and-one place and his watch that was left was actually working and not frozen in time.\\n- The events that were the result of the 2 worlds crossing disappeared. For example, Sin-Jae\\'s pic from Tae-ul\\'s world.\\nNote that after she fired the successful shot then the King took care of Lee Lim. (At first I thought it was weird the order of things and had to really use my brain cells to figure this one out.)\\nThe Fast Romance: diehardfan explains it the best. You have to understand it could be at least 3-4 months by the time they see each other next. So while apart, they are actually not apart because they were thinking of each other and longing to be in the company of each other. This is why the next time they see each other, they keep saying, \"I missed you\", or \"Have you been waiting for me?\" It just solidifies the saying, \"Absence makes the heart grows fonder\".\\nThis is really not your typical romance. If you don\\'t know when or if you will ever see the other person again, you will probably do what they do - gladly accept your fate and live in the moment. Cause all you really are guaranteed is just that moment. I think if they put a time caption on when the King meets Tae-Eul next (ex: \"6 months later\") that would help the audience understand their time constraints better.\\nShin-Jae Jeez, Kim Kyung-Nam is just too cool. His acting was just spot on when his mother ran out to give him a hug…. and he didn\\'t even have to say one word. Bravo!!!\\nOverall, I don\\'t recommend this show for just anyone. If you are a deep thinker and like to solve a good mystery then this is right up your alley. It\\'s really a show that keeps on giving because it does require a lot of utilizing the brain cells to get the full impact of the plot. Even after rewatching things, you start to notice more clues that you didn\\'t really notice before. I love it and hoping there will be a sequel!\\n\\n',\n",

Both actors are amazing, there IS chemistry between the main casts, that's for sure. However the writing - there was not enough time for the romance to develop due to the amount of fantasy parallel dimension plot that needed to be explained.

I think that there is probably too little episodes to expand the loops and holes. At first it seems like out of blue they just fell in love which does not make sense. But actually everytime min ho goes back to his kingdom, it takes time for him to come back and so the time the spent together and the time they are not together somehow made them think of each other more often and made them fall in love for each other. Min ho has to travel back and forth to get to the present because he can only travel one way which at first did not make sense too. But I had to watch it again to understand. Over all it is a decent drama. Great for covid 19 isolation.\\n\\n',\n",

I had expectations because I know both of these actors are really good but I guess this was just not it.

As for the middle section of the series, it picked up and it became cool and interesting, even with the fast-paced relationship that felt like it came out of nowhere (though they're cute, as long as they're out of character).\\nProduction was amazing, actors were amazing, especially Woo Do Hwan, Kim Go Eun, and Kim Kyung Nam.\\nWoo Do Hwan nailed his role, it was cool to see him act as if he had 4 characters instead of 2.\\nIt was nice to see a different side of Kim Kyung Nam, he was so different on Prison Playbook (which is worth the watch!!)\\nSPOILER!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\nSPOILER!!!!!!!\\nAs for the last two episodes, especially the last episode, it was disappointing again. My expectations weren't that high anymore because of the previous events in previous episodes, but the finale was definitely a letdown. For someone who's so desperate to live an eternity, Lee Lim disappointed me. It felt so easy.\\nThe script of the whole drama was mostly disappointing, considering how good Mr. Sunshine is overall. There were so many loopholes, and even though you can explain it with assumptions, I feel like it will be better to actually confirm it through the script. It was as if the writer just put whatever she wanted to the story. To be honest, a lot of people finished it for the sake of finishing it as well, giving up on trying to make the story make sense.\\nI mean, you could watch it again or watch it slowly, and make some assumptions for the loopholes, but it's not worth it for me.\\n\\n\",\n",

Remember how it didn\\'t recognize Lee Gon when he tried to open the portal? But when Lee Gon puts it in Lee Lim\\'s hand then the portal appears.\\n\"So I’m guessing that Kim Go Eun will never be recognized in his country as the love of his life let alone Queen? That was a big disappointment.....why was he still hiding her\\xa0? Was it because Luna was still alive\\xa0? So the prince saved life was not restored\\xa0?\"\\nYes, it was because Luna is still alive. They spent all this effort to remove proof of another world and can not start that cycle again.\\nYeah, this was a huge disappointment for me on the finale. If he wasn\\'t a king then that ending is fine. But because he is a king, they have to end it with the kingdom at least have a chance of having a legitimate heir to continue the lineage. With this ending, the people got screwed because we are led to believe he won\\'t ever have an heir because he is so besotted with her.\\nI would have preferred for Tae-Eul to be killed then he goes to another timeline and they fall in love with each other again. But then we will have the same problem. Or maybe he moves on wth his life but his doppelgänger in other timelines falls in love with Tae-Eul because they are fated to be together. I would have been ok with that.\\nAnother thing that really bothers me is no explanation on the red glowing scars. They really left us hanging with that! The only explanation I could think of is anyone who has the scar is fated to have their doppelgänger be killed. That\\'s the only common denominator I could see. Any thoughts?\\n\\n',\n",

Worst of all, at the time it was airing The World Of The Married had me by the throat so I had no room for anything else. Last night, I was bored so I decided to throw away one or two hours on this drama to see why everyone hated. And thus commenced the marathon.\\nA day later, I'm done and I have to say it's not as bad as sold. I mean it's not 'Mr. Sunshine' but it's on par with Goblin. It's shine was just dulled by the fact that it was up against a power-house drama. Most of the things people found confusing were just because they were impatient. If you're a person who enjoys mysteries, you'll love seeing the unexplained twists slowly unraveling. As for the claims of lack of chemistry between the leads, it's obviously a rumor made up by people who haven't watched 'Lovely Horribly' . Lee Gon and Tae-Eul's relationship started fast but when it caught on, it was bittersweet and kept on pulling at my heartstrings.\\nI feel like everyone who had a doppelganger gave applause-deserving performances.

I’m one of those people who found it boring around ep.6-9 but after rewatching it I was blown away how many I’ve missed and totally live it after that. This drama gave me a unique experience where it’s my first time commenting online even joining a group just to share my theories , spend hours searching different peoples theories even studied some math/ science related stuff. I might not be good drama for others but for me this is the Best Drama for me not just because the story , and actors but the experience that this drama gave me it makes me interact with the stranger just to share a theory and I feel like I made new friends because of this drama. Im not a fan of Lee min ho. I can’t even finish most of his drama as they’re just typical cliche. As for Kim Go Eun I know that she’s an excellent actress but I can say that Goblin is not for me . This drama made me a fan for both of them.I thank the writers, actors and crew for making this extraordinary drama despite the criticism and harsh bashing . I know more extra ordinary drama will come but TKEM will always be special to my Heart. Thank you for the experience . I’m crying\\xa0?\\n\\n',\n",

Some people would call me a weirdo because I prefer The King: Eternal Monarch rather than Crash Landing On You, but that's because The King had some unexpected scenes. CLOY was too obvious. And I also prefer it because it has my favorite actors, Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun. Add the writer too! I'm glad that they were apart of the drama. It's quite sad that it's finished. I can't believe that a lot of people critize this drama. Especially Lee Gon and Tae-eul's chemistry. To me, it was awesome. This will always be my favorite drama.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nTan Jun 13 2020 11:36 am \\nLong story short, this kdrama was a roasted chicken with no seasoning. It's the kind of chicken that you consider a decent meal, but it won't leave you hanging and hoping to eat it again later, nor will you remember it.\\nWhile I agree with other comments that Lee Min Ho was quite emotionless in this role, the drama on its own failed to bring out any tears or feelings. Although the drama does cover the suffering of many people between the two worlds, their stories always lacked depth and ended up being undeveloped.\\nAt the same time, the drama constantly clung onto safety and refused to let anyone important die. As an example (SPOILERS ahead), when both the Royal Guard Captain and his comedian counter-part from the other world got shot and were saved by their bulletproof vests, the writer missed a good opportunity to kill off the comedian counter-part and introduce the consequences of mixing fates of people from two parallel dimensions. That would have resulted in an actual tear jerker this drama needed, and a significant challenge for Lee Gon's and Tae Eul's romance.\\nThe only time this drama was close to a tear jerker was when Lee Gon's uncle died, however even that was too sudden and didn't have the impact it should have had, it just happened out of nowhere, but also didn't surprise me.\\nI can't help but compare it to Goblin since the drama has a similar concept and the same female lead actress... Goblin somehow succeeded in making a story that didn't have an obvious plot or ending, whereas Eternal Monarch just stuck with the recycled. Overall this kdrama does not have any re-watch value for me, the romance between the leads was pretty shallow overall.\\n\\n\",\n",

I slept off in episode 1 and 2 but then i realized that the story itself was actually interesting and wanted to find out how it unfolded. It was unfolding really well until they decided to add time travel to it and this left holes in the drama that just does't make sense no matter how you try to explain it.

       " '\\nstechira Jun 13 2020 11:09 am \\nSPOILERS! I can understand why people are complaining that this flopped after episode 13. The whole time travelling thing became a big problem and that is because it created so much loop holes in the drama. Letting them keep their memory was the biggest loop hole in the drama since it cannot correspond with the past they later created. If the past really changed then he should never have known her hence their memory should not exist. Then there is the problem with lee lim, if he was killed by his past self then the drama has ended because the bad guy is gone but since he still existed that means we followed the one that did the killing, then that would mean there are more lee gon travelling through time since he has never died. Argh! this is so twisted, they should have just made them fall in love with their respective world selves. That would have been a better ending, after all the romance was boring as there was no chemistry.\\n\\n',\n",

About 95% of the questions that pop up are answered by the end.\\nMaybe more could have been done to tell Lee Lim and Lee Gon's personal stories (Lee Gon's character in particular was very bland), as they both seem quite typical hero and villain characters that could have had more of a personal story. But you know when watching that each scene has been planned out a long time in advance, nothing has been added in accidentally, and that really shows in the last episodes of the drama where they tie everything together.\\nThe visuals are absolutely insane, just like a hollywood movie, except this is a weekly drama on a free-to-air channel. And all the acting was superb, especially by the supporting characters. The editing of the scenes and feel of the drama reminded me a lot of Goblin as well.\\nAll in all, I hadn't expected too much from the drama when I started and yes it was slow in some places, but I found it to still be an enjoyable drama to watch while at home during the pandemic. The science-fiction elements are quite well thought out and leave you curious to know how things happen and where the story will go, so even if you're not interested in the romance aspect you may find the sci-fi aspect quite entertaining.\\n\\n\",\n",

I suppose it made a great dramatic scene, but I think it was kinda silly. (I love Maximus though. I love the scene where little LG watching little Maximus from the side with Head Lady Noh). Another scene that I found a little bit annoying is when Luna stabbed JTE. Why JTE decided to confront Luna alone when she knows that Luna is dangerous and Eun Seop can easily be a back-up since he has been following Luna? Furthermore, there are a lot of advertisements. But, I gotta give thumbs up to the writer that she can weave them into the storyline. And now I'm still waiting for the last episode. I hope the writer is kind enough to give us a happy ending. At the very least, like she gave us the ending of Goblin. She was generous enough to give us an epilogue in the end of Goblin.\\n\\n\",\n",

I’ve noticed that the things the bad guy - Lee Lim does are hardly shown, they just sit down and start talking about it instead. A lot of scenes in this drama are so boring I find myself forward a lot.\\nThey Also spend too much time advertising that i feel embarrassed for the actors. I also noticed that it’s usually Lee min ho and Jung Eun Chae advertising products lol.\\nI’m now finding It’s annoying how the FL cries every time she sees the ML. I love KGE and I thought she was supposed to be a strong and sensible character. Why is she crying in every scene of every episode OMG?? And I also find it hilarious how she single handedly was going to handle Luna and ended up getting stabbed. She should know that Luna was dangerous.\\nThere are too many characters in this drama OMG! There is not enough time to show all of them. I also thought the writer was a pro like what is this??\\n\\n',\n",

Mystery after mystery, slowly unravelling each plot makes you more excited about the upcoming episodes. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching 'The King: Eternal Monarch'. Extremely excited to see next week’s episode and how it will be completed. I really hope the ending of this drama will make a justice to the entire story. Lots of love to the team of 'The King: Eternal Monarch' for creating such a unique storyline. Being a drama lover, I would have to say that it is really satisfying to watch a fresh piece of work, that doesn’t just involve romance but considers other genres, characters and their relationships to the right level.\\n\\n\",\n",

It has a very complex plot and a lot of twists. It requires concentration and rewatching of the previous episodes. But it has depth and full of emotion.\\nI watched it twice and had long discussions with my BFF about each scene in the released episodes. Best pleasure ever.\\nThe actors did great job. For me, the best actor award should be given to Woo Do-Hwan. As a secondary character he has stolen the whole show. I'm so waiting to see him in lead roles.\\nIt sucks that the drama didn't get the high ratings it deserves, but like I said - it doesn't suit everyone.\\nFor me, this drama received a score of 11 out of 10. Hope the writers will release more series such as Goblin, Descendants of the Sun and The King- Eternal Monarch.\\xa0\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nmlc Jun 07 2020 6:10 am \\nCompared to other k-dramas, this would fall on the \"heavy\" side, needing the viewer to give more than the usual attention to the dialogues, and watching the previous episodes is a must, to understand the progression of the story. Yet over-all, I would still rate it as one of the best I have ever seen. LMH is undoubtedly the best among the best of actors, and he carried the drama extremely well from beginning to end. Considering all the restrictions of having to film during the covid outbreak, the staff (director, script writer, etc) still managed to come up with a great project. To all of you, specially LMH, a big kudos and more power. To me, in a scale of 1-10, I would rate this a grand 11. To those who got \"lost\" while watching, I suggest to watch it again, to fully understand the story. Again, congratulations for a job well done. And LMH, you haven\\'t lost anything at all. You have proven once again that you are not just a pretty face, but one of the best actors ever.\\n\\n',\n",

I might be the one person on the planet who is not a fan of Kim Go-Eun but just can not bring myself to like her. She cries well is about the only thing I can say. I just find her bland and uninteresting. I find the chemistry between the two leads to be very forced and unnatural. I am a huge fan of Lee Min-Ho but even he is having a hard time saving this drama. I think the kings bodyguard Woo Do-Hwan has done a fabulous job with his two characters and has stolen the show in many scenes. The pieces should have fit together beautifully but they did not.\\n\\n',\n",

For me, I love it, waiting every week, reading and making up possibly “theories”, fangirling + crying over spectacular scenes. I understand why some people don’t like it but it goes straight up to my top 3, after Goblin and DOTS. Once you start, don’t stop cause it just gets better and better!!

How about the king traveling through time to get back 2020.... just nerve wracking!!!!! I was like will it be years before he gets back to her.

After I watched this drama I was very carried away by the cinematography which is very beautiful and the depiction of each episode is very detailed. This drama is very good-by connecting aspects of science, mathematics in a parallel world. This work deserves appreciation because of the imagination and thought that is far beyond the ordinary that would have been imagined before. Continue to do your best in this drama.\\n\\n',\n",

I still remember the moment I was too excited and couldn't contain my joy just reading about the releasing date of this drama. Oh the plot, oh the dazzling stars, oh the fantasy genre which I always adore. But it left a bitter taste in my mouth the more I began to watch it. I can't help to compare it to The World of Marriage, which was airing at the same time slot, and now I just stop tuning into The King on Netflix. Utter disappointment, boring dragging plot with no climax, a waste of talented actors and actresses. This drama's product placement was severe. You'd think it's a 1 hour advertisement of people consecutively eating fried chicken, drinking The Alley boba milk tea, and smearing Laneige makeup. Nonetheless to say, I quit at 6th episode. And that was I really tried to go on, but couldn't.\\n\\n\",\n",

And makes me crazy to think what to happen in the next episode. It was like I can’t wait for another week for the next episodes.

But im honestly losing interest sometimes. The pacing is really really slow. However i dont wanna drop it because i love seeing Dohwan and Kyungnam and this drama is something i can just sit through. I honestly admire everyone behind this because it's something huge and im also aware of the long preparations of the team for this drama but it's really not something i can really invest myself into.

       " '\\nGT May 27 2020 10:40 am \\nIf a show needs twelve episodes to finally get interesting and pick up its pace, it cannot be the best drama of the season or the year or ever. As many have mentioned, the potential was there from the very start, but the pacing has always been problematic. Having a plot twist at the end of every episode, with the rest of it being very lacklustre, doesn’t qualify it to be a good drama. I get that many people have differing opinions about the chemistry between the leads, but truth be told, the scene stealers remain the supporting characters like WDH and the Prime Minister. LMH and KGE may have the star power as the leads, but think the writer has made their relationship overly convoluted and thus, too much of a soap opera.\\n\\n',\n",

I waited for it, I'm watching it since ep 1, I don't mind its flaws most of the time (complicated story, questionable chemistry, PPLs rivaling the Truman Show ect.).\\nBut sometimes it gives me so much frustration and makes me cringe so bad that it’s just hard to overcome. I started to hope that it finally will leave its cheesiness behind as it gets more intense, but it just striked again…\\n(I can't be the only one who almost thrown their laptop away when the supposed to be super smart king come with his horse and sword against the supposed to be super evil genius guy's gang whom only had baseball bats?!! In 2020!? And they had to play it twice... That scene was so bad in so many ways it left me speechless... So glad it was the end of the episode because I could delete it from my head before the next part and skipped it the second time.)\\nI feel like story wise the writer wants us to be smart, understand and piece together the hints, but on the other hand they expect us to behave like teenage girls who just watch the king on the white horse with heart eyes no matter what he does and how long he does it. Like: „Here, watch his face for a few minutes again. You want to know what will happen? Later. For now, just watch him a little longer.“\\nI wish they'd just cut down the amount of these parts because I feel like all the great potential the characters and the story has is being sacrificed for those scenes.\\nAnyways. I still cannot wait for the next eps, I'm super curious what will happen now that the story is actually moving forward. So sad that there're only 4 eps left\\xa0:'( I hope the writer'll give the show a nice ending, not necessarily happy, but clean and suitable.\\n\\n\",\n",

Love the scenes where she put these male political officials in their place.   One says all she does is just put on make up.  She comes back with if that's all it takes to do the job then you can do it too.   Bam!  Strike 1!  When the Japanese was going to invade their territorial water, she says we've talked them out of it the 1st two times, what's it going be like the 4th time (implying if we don't take It serious now)? One guy says we'll have to wait and see...   She comes back with...we are not ordering food here!   Bam!  Strike 2!  If you want to wait then wait until you are Prime Minister!    Bam!  Strike 3! \\n\\nThe scary part is the King and she is a very powerful team. The potential is there. You actually need this team to deal with the Japanese. But darn, I think the uncle Is gonna recruit her. I hope she isn't labeled as a traitor in the end. It would be a shame because her motivation is not evil like the uncle. She's just got ambition. She knows what she wants and she is not shy about going after what she wants. Hope she will outsmart him. Between her and Luna he won't know what hit him. Yeah!\\nI also don't care about the ratings. This is an excellent show. It forces you to think about things... for example, what would\\nyou do if you were the King and you don't get the queen\\nyou want? His life already sucks as it is with the uncle business. Being with her is the only thing that makes him happy. Hey producers, can we please give this guy a break in the end? On the other hand, what would you do if you were her? Would you abandon all your prior close relationships to be with him? There is no visiting business. It's an all or nothing. The portal must be closed and they are running against the clock each time\\nsomeone passes over the portal. If it continues, both worlds will perish. Either way, I think it will be a bittersweet ending. Unavoidable....\\nAnyway, the entire cast is really awesome. Oh yeah Yangmi. OMG he is adorable!

It is as if the writer had a beautiful picture of a puzzle in his or her head but put the pieces all wrong and the result is distorted. Some times the plot is very slow, other times it's fine. Either way the drama manages to make you lose interest because of the inconsistency. And it is a pitty because the acting is great and the plot basis is solid. Is it the direction, is it the writing? For me it went south somewhere in there. Also, what the heck is their deal with sponsors? We get it you want to advertise but this is ridiculous.

Plus the characters aren’t one dimensional, so much depth and very memorable ...And damn, the leads have a ton of chemistry! It’s not in-your-face, annoying/cringe-y “cuteness” like many romcoms, but a subtle & sweet chemistry with natural progression.

I find a happy ending kind of unrealistic even though this drama is fantasy and there’s been too many hints that it’s a sad ending. If it’s a happy ending, that’s wonderful but I’m aiming for a sad ending if though LeeEul deserve happiness. Sometimes sad endings are meant to be and it’s good to have a good cry. I want Lee Lim to kill more people because I want to see more action going on. But yet again, there’s only 4 more episodes which makes me wonder how are they going to wrap up everything with so many unanswered questions and plot twists? I don’t think sbs will extended the episodes but could they perhaps extended the duration of the episodes? It’ll be better. I really enjoyed ep 11, I don’t know why it’s the lowest rating. Boy some of the other low rating episodes were kind of understandable but ep 11? Jeez what was south career even watching. I personally liked ep 11 and ep 12 very much. I know some people are not fond of LMH and KGE chemistry on screen but to me in ep 12, their chemistry was overflowing. I loved the kiss but why did the zoom out. Bruh like what were the camera directors thinking. Next time close up kiss and more scandalous\\xa0?. I can’t believe there’s only 2 more weeks left, it’s been a wild journey.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\nKdramaCutiePie May 17 2020 11:40 am \\nWhere to start?\\nI was really excited before the show aired, I loved the sneak peeks and trailers. Knowing the cast, the writer and seeing parts of the story made me all hyped up.\\nThen I started watching, if we look solely at the storyline, let’s be honest. It’s a gem, you can do so much with 2 worlds, people who look exactly the same as you, love that expands 2 worlds. But then the story started to unfold, my oh my, I’m dissatisfied. The first episode was perfect, an introduction. From the second episode the writer should’ve started to incorporate little things that would build up to the love arc. The love arc was too forced, which makes it less believable, hence why so many people say that can’t see the chemistry. Because it’s there, but for us viewers chemistry needs to have a foundation. Little things that draw us in and makes us want them to be together.\\nBecause there are two worlds, we get introduced to many characters. The ones that live in our world and the people who live in the kingdom, each of them has a story and the drama tries to at least show us how the villain is replacing people. But it’s too much, too many characters and storylines. Which leaves less time to make us get invested in the main cast and their character development. The constant off editing doesn’t make it any better.\\nThe drama as a puzzle is ok, I found a lot of easter eggs and I’m watching the show to see the ending unfold.\\nBut I would like to take a moment and talk about Woo Do Hwan, what a talent. His acting is off the charts and I can’t get enough of him. The way he makes it totally believable that there are really 2 people with the same face but totally different characters. I’m loving every scene he’s in and he’s the reason i look forward to new episodes. He’s the one carrying the show, at least for me. I hope I haven’t offended anybody. This is my honest review. Please don’t question my intellect, because I get the story and the complicated plots and twists. I just think it’s poorly written and executed.\\n\\n',\n",

The writer has had her hits, but actually this one is a lil bit of a miss. It could have been better had it been directed by another director. Yes to the comment re Goblin director. I personally still love watching it, but I get it why the ratings are not as expected. Each episode doesn’t have its own mini mystery to solve, not enough cliffhanger. It definitely doesn’t have enough oomph for a fantasy drama, almost too vanilla. Though I have to disagree with comments about the lacking main leads chemistry. I think they definitely have good chemistry, but it’s not oozing because of the way their storyline and characters are written. It’s a different kind of romance. I love it cause it feels realistic. A mature relationship between a king and a police officer, no push and pull. And Woo Do Hwan is just adorable in this drama! Would love to see more of Young and Eun Sup with Na Ri and Seung A. I will keep watching to the end. Despite everything, I’m still pulled into these two worlds.\\n\\n',\n",

I’m really can’t wait for the next episode because of the preview. They can’t just leave us hanging like that. After reading some theories on twitter, I believe that it is Lee Gon’s future self who was kissing Taeeul at the end. He was wearing the same outfit we saw in ep 1: The words he was saying seemed a bit off and was kind of hinting something. Jung taeeul also stepped back when he met lee gon which makes me wonder why. Is it just me but I want Lee Lim to kill more people. Obviously not the main cast but other people because I want to see more action. I do think today’s episode did not flow smoothly. We had to go into about 20 minutes where we left off from ep 9. I think the beginning scenes could of been remove. Also, I’m sure the timelines were different because there were many cuts but it was not displayed. Overall I really enjoyed ep 9 and 10 were the best episodes. Really can’t wait for ep 11\\n\\n',\n",

And Since the first eps i start to compares this drama with Goblin, ii really loved goblin, the cinematography was superb, both if the drama has superb cinematography, but i just annoyed by the characters of FL on goblin, but i still can feels the romance between the ML and FL on goblin, at least the romance between the two are well developed, not perfect but i can understand and following their developing feelings for each other, and we know from the start the FL is the destined bride for ML. On the other hand, for The King, i can’t, the FL is less annoying than FL on goblin, really KGE characters as police woman on this drama is much way better cause the FL is strong, independent, and smart. But like other people says about the chemistry, the sudden “I Love You” what the f? How come you suddenly loved someone when on the previous eps the FL didn’t show any sparks of being fallin i love to the ML, even when ML kissed the FL, she barely show any feeling of love, come on, if she is a stright forward person why dont you make a better story telling for both of them to develops natural Love story, cause when i saw the scene FL said I Love You, the so many questions that crossed my mind\\xa0: Am i missing some scene? How come she said I Love You with that straight face? Why you started to fall in love to the man who stalks you with no identity and seems crazy (cause he said he is the king from other world), and suddenly you fallen in love? Cause now you know he is the real king from another dimensions? I think what make it feels forces is because as long as I watched every episode both of them are barely talked deeply about each other as a couple, even the ML whose longing to meet FL is need more time to ensure his feeling for her, feels like they don’t know each other deeply to said love to each other, they dont have much time as a couple, they are from different world, so the writer and director should know better that they need a Good Romance story line to intertwined their fate as a couple\\n\\n',\n",

I can’t believe it’s the same person playing eunseop and joyeong. Sorry but eunseop >>> joyeong. I hope neither of them dies. The cinematography is out of this world, so so beautiful. One of the best cinematography in the kdrama world. The thing I like the most about this drama is the storyline. The storyline is so interesting and hasn’t been done before and I can’t wait to find out more about Lee Lim’s ambition and how Lee Gon will defeat him. Oh, and the theories. There are so many theories and I love reading them. Everyone are like detectives lol. However, there are some aspects about this drama which I wish can improve on. The romance is very bland. Sorry but you have to admit the truth. Even if you’re fans of both of the leads, you can immediately tell that the romance writing is lacking. I personally think there wasn’t enough romance build up between taeeul and lee gon. I’m head over heals with this pair but I understand why viewers are frustrated and confused on how taeeul fell for Lee gon, details were missing. Lee minho and Kim goeun have better chemistry off screen than on screen lol. I still love their romance moments though. One thing for sure that I know everyone is annoyed about is the amount of PPL. I know that every drama there’s PPL but TKEM’s PPL are too obvious. The cringy lines with it is so bad. The production crew can at least try to blend it more well and not make it so obvious. It feels like a commercial drama. Last con, the plot is too slow. There’s only three more weeks left until the drama ends and I don’t even know how they’re going to wrap this up smoothly. The action has only begun now and that’s more than half of the drama. The drama focused way too less on the main objective. Also, there are many secrets being revealed but it also feels like we know nothing at all. They’re saying so much but also nothing at the same time. I hope they don’t cram everything at the end. Nonetheless, I enjoy this drama. It’s my first ongoing kdrama that I’m watching from the very start and I’m always looking forward for the next episodes. I’m on twitter daily, scrolling and reading theories lol. I’m 70% sure it will have a sad ending. The amount of foreshadowing points it out. But you know, sometimes sad endings are meant to be and it’s good to have a cry sometimes. Anyways, I just really hope the ratings will go up soon. I hate how the Korean media always have something bad to say about this drama every week. It’s like someone is purposely trying to drag TKEM down. Please just stop.

Like what? how? when?. & also the advertisements in this drama is so annoying so freaking annoying. I am so done with the coffee, the mask and the kimchi brand they are showing. It is so visible. The only thing that lets me continue the drama is because of do hwan! he deserves a million awards for his acting skills. He was able to portray both of the characters greatly. He has a very bright future ahead.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nCalifornia girl May 15 2020 11:36 am \\nThis drama had a slow transition. For me, 1-6 episodes was a little bit dragging. Episode 8 is where the real action starts. But you cannot skip a single episode at the beginning because you will not understand the flow of the story. I love the ending of episode 8 and this is the reason why I couldn’t wait for episode 9. There are unnecessary scenes during the first half of this drama. I still do think that they could have done a better storytelling between Gon and Taeul’s affection for each other. But that is just one part of the story. Episode 9, their chemistry is finally showing. You just have to put aside the weird “love story” in the beginning. Now, there is definitely more action. The cinematography of this drama is fantastic! I’m not very fond of their songs, nothing really catchy for me but it worked out for most of the scenes. Everyone is doing a great job putting out their best acts. LMH might appear to be stoic in this drama but his subtle expressions and his overall aura just fits the role of a king. His deep voice can go from flat, to soft to fierce. I love it that his role is intelligent and fierce yet in front of Taeul and the old lady in the palace, he becomes soft. In episode 9, LMH’s acting really stood out. I can now truly, truly say that this is an amazing drama! This show is a good one and probably one of the most interesting dramas I have ever watched. The dark side of this story is what really pulls me. You become so immersed to it because it makes you think. Some people don’t like it but as long as I like it, who cares about opinions. Koreans should be proud that they have talented people who can bring out an awesome project like this one. I think it is underrated and it just doesn’t make sense to me. All the actors in this drama were so on point. I hope they get plenty of rewards. Kudos!\\n\\n',\n",

He acting is gracious and he does portray that of a mathematician. He pauses and ponder a few times over difficult sudden issues, like when the girl JTE said \"I love you\". On top of that he acted \"kingly\". I am hooked to this show because of the sci-fi element and I think hard how it would end.\\nMay be it will end like Alice in the wonderland, where the main cast LMH or JTE will wake up from their dreams.

You need to bring your “thinking cap” to get all the twists and turns of every scene of every episode because they are all related.

I really wanted to like this drama a lot because I enjoy a good sci fi series once in a while, and the premise of the parallel worlds looked really interesting. However the writers seemed to be dragging out the drama on purpose. By the time it reached ep 5 and that weird kiss thing happened, I stopped watching. From the latest comments, it looked as if the female lead’s confession also didn’t make sense to some viewers. I don’t doubt that the leads have huge fan bases, but even in the few eps that I watched, I found the supporting actors more intriguing. I may come back to this later if the pace and storyline improve, but it’s definitely not because of the painfully dreary love story between the leads.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\nCalifornia girl May 13 2020 11:08 am \\nThe plot was very confusing during the first 4 episodes. I had to repeat those episodes few times in order for me to understand where the flow of the story is going. I agree that there are just too many cheesy lines, I am not excited with the love story but more on the mystery of this drama. LMH is just given a script to act on. His acting goes well with him being a king. He is not supposed to act like a clown. He is supposed to be more serious, intelligent and very much well educated. That was the character that he is supposed to play. I agree as well that his character here is a bit bland but I don’t think he is a bad actor. He is not the best actor but to say that he is horrible with his acting is just not right. It’s difficult to compare all their acts in this drama because they are all given different roles to play. I think they all did their parts well. As for the romance, I cannot understand this love story at all. The FL doesn’t seem to show that she fell in love with him. If she did, I cannot find it in any of the episodes that’s already out. I guess I am just not feeling the love story of the lead couple. There’s no building up. It feels like out of nowhere, there comes love that only the actors of the drama, the director and scriptwriter can understand. This is what’s missing from this drama. I don’t blame the actors. I blame it more on how it was written. This parallel world concept may not appeal to many people but for me, it is quite interesting. I love the mystery of this drama and it is quite unique. You will get confused the first time you watch it and that’s why paying attention to each character, each event is very important when you watch this drama. 8 episodes out already and now I can see how it will turn around. It may not have the best ratings but it is not a bad drama. You just need patience and pay attention with their lines, events and people in order for you not to get lost. Don’t be too harsh on the actors of this drama. I am sure they are doing their best to bring out the characters to life. No matter how famous they are, they do get hurt. Your harsh words are like stones being thrown at them and they didn’t do anything bad to you. All they did was to act and bring entertainment.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nMichelle May 13 2020 10:16 am \\nSame stoic LMH face, anyway what else to expect from him? I think the side actors are doing much better especially WDH and KKN. Their stories and acting are extremely better than the male lead. The back story of SJ's much more interesting and something to look forward to. WDH's double role is outstanding, he's a show stealer here. The romance isn't there or maybe because the writer thinks that it'll make our heart flutter even before establishing the main lead's loveline, but no at least not for me. The cheesy lines are for fangirls only, nothing more. The confessions of both leads was like reciting an English poem in front of the class, it feels cringey rather than cute. Bromance isn't reaching my liking as well, it's funny that I see bromance between Jo Eun Seob and Jo Yeong more. Watching this only for WDH and KKN.\\nThe rating's speak for itself, barely hitting double digits. We're already half of the drama and I think ML is more focused on his obsession with the FL. Anyway, there's a lot of upcoming drama out there that's more interesting.\\n\\n\",\n",

I love the way they didn't drag it out, her affection towards Lee Gon, I mean, in some dramas, there will come a scene that u would already knw that the “I love you” is gonna come, after all the play hard to get. In this case she has been thinking about it for a while and she just has to let it out as there are better things to do going forward in the movie like eliminating the enemies and closing the gate between the parallel worlds.

The prime minister pisses me off, is she even allowed to go behind the court like that?\\n\\n',\n",

That's what really got me to watch it in the first place. I get confused by the switching of scenes though. I dunno if that's deliberate or what. As for the romance, I find them adorable. This isn't a slow burn story tbh. Fast paced and with a lot of characters. I really think it'll be rewarding moving forward. On how the plot will wrap, how it'll all make sense in the end.\\nTo the ones watching, I'm watching with you.\\nTo those who dropped the series, well, hope you'll reconsider soon.\\nTo those who are refusing to watch because of the ratings and bad comments, try seeing some episodes first. =)\\n\\n\",\n",

I don't get why the King was so smitten with her when he first saw her. I mean yes he does know her for 24 years but not as a love interest. The ID was just the nearest connection he has for his savior and that's that. However, the way it was written makes it looks like he loves her all his life. The romance scene was so abrupt. Nonetheless, I'm still hooked with the drama. I just accepted it and I'm still rooting for the two of them to get a proper storyline as a couple.\\nThe drama itself was like a super ambitious thesis proposal but somewhere along the way the proponent lost its way from the course of its topic.\\n\\n\",\n",

First of, The reason why a lot of people find this drama boring, is because there is no endgame in sight, we cant connect with the characters because they’re written in such a dry manner. No one seems to have a personality (the only interesting take at the moment is the body gaurd and his doppelgänger). There is no build up towards a romantic relationship and there’s no real connection between the two main characters. It literally came out of nowhere and didn’t make any sense. The female lead is a spectacular actress, but she’s unemotional throughout and because lee min ho’s character is reserved, it just doesn’t balance each other out. She hasn’t expressed ANY believable feelings for him. They could literally just be friends. They didn’t do anything together to solidify that this was going in a romantic direction and they both ended up being dry. So you can’t feel anything deep between the two. As for the story? Because they want to DRAG this mysterious role that the villain is playing, It ends up making watchers lose interest. They’ve literally been dragging his goal for like 8 episodes straight. We watch and then realize what he’s up to. We can’t feel who these characters are because we haven’t been given any emotions or memories/ flashbacks: encounters to make us feel for them. So we know WHO they are, or how they were before. Besides the body gaurd and the prime minister, everyone else is just bland.\\n\\n',\n",

But in the republican. of korea, lee gin read somewhere that one of the king died so that’s why the two universe are so different but if the king died in the republic that means that he didn’t have any descendants right? Or is children would have taken his place? so that means that lee gon’s parent shouldn’t have been born in the republic and neither would have lee gon.

And the satisfaction it gave to viewers remain. TKEM challenges the IQ and EQ of likers, lurkers, and haters. And that made the story more interesting. Lead cast openly expressed their initial confusion but after reading the entire script they liked the original concept of a fictional parallel world (RK and fictional KC) and the unique dual characters they need to work on 2) The portrayal of actors/actresses varies on the personality/background of the character they are assigned to. Lee Gon is a mathematician (stigma: serious, scientific, assertive, theory based, above all geek, not much of the demonstrative type) before he became the king. LMH is able to muster and deliver the opposing attributes of his character. Jeong Tae-eul is motherless at 5y.o., a street smart kid who decided to become brave that's why she became a detective. She is straightforward, no-nonsense, with issues on showing her femininity or the lady in her. And yes, KGE delivered it well! As for the rest of the cast, a big round of applause to all of them!!! They've been doing great!!! 3) On chemistry of LMH and KGE? we hv subjective / personal biases on this .... but the behind the scenes and interviews expressly and impliedly showed the degree of chemistry they've developed. So it's a thumbs up! 4) for the CGI, i dont have issues on it coz im after the essence of the scene and 5) As for the rating, I am confident the succeeding episodes will draw in attention with heightened mystery, shared loved (70% of LeeGon's mind is.occupied by Jeong Tae-eul), action and unexpected turn of events (wch screenwriter Kim Eun-soo is known for).\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nBea May 04 2020 8:24 am \\nI agree with those here that say how interesting the concept is but the execution is either boring or confusing. In medical dramas, even if they spew all those terms i do not understand, it's fine by me. But here, nope, just have to skip those math stuff. Maybe because the med terms in the dramas help move the story forward but the math terms here looks like they're used simply to rub the fact that yes, the king is a mathematician and yes, this is a scifi/fantasy drama. Even the story telling is slow. Hope the upcoming episodes are better. I really have expectations for this show.\\n\\n\",\n",

No chemistry between LMH and KGE. The kiss seemed so forced. Dialogues are so cheesy. LMH is still acting like when he was in BOF, Inheritors and so on.

LMH’s acting is idk, its kinda boring as usual. I agree with the comment below that he puts me to sleep too lol. No offense. He’s just hot, that’s all. I like Woo do hwan/Joyoung’s character and acting more, serious in another world and funny or playful in another world. Loved his accent too. So far, i like kim go eun’s character here too, better than Goblin. The show also feels like another Goblin show, but i find this more interesting than Goblin (i dropped that one). It’s a little bit confusing at some parts, but bearable. I just skip the science part or math coz i have no idea what theyre talking about. Anyways, i’m probably gonna keep on watching. It’s definitely not the best show, but it looks like a high budget show, and the cinematography is good. The casts are popular but not the best actors in my opinion. That is probably why they got high ratings. Story is interesting though a little confusing and slow, and sometimes boring and doesnt make sense. But i like guns and im hoping for some action, and I like the OSTs, so 50/50 i might end up finishing this or not.\\n\\n',\n",

She portray her role effectively. And the story is not really simple. There is a lot of thinking and guessing here because of the parallel universe and dual characters.That is why this is new in Korean Drama and unique on its own.

The cinematography , acting of the actors and overall, the plot has really caught my attention. Although confusing in the first 3 episodes, episode 4 has really proven to me that I should keep watching and supporting this drama. Towards the ending of the episode, we can see the development in not only the story, but the relationship between the 2 main characters (watch it for yourself if curious\\xa0;)). So, if you are unsure to watch it or not due to the ratings, I suggest that you give this drama a try.

There's always something to look for in every scene: a clue, the majestic backgrounds, and the beautiful faces of the cast (especially Lee Minho's because he is extremely pleasing to look at). I rewatched the first two episodes at least three times and I was glad I did because I made some theories about certain scenes that I missed. Also, there are little details in Lee Minho's and Woo Dohwan's acting that I missed and it gave me butterflies when I caught them (Lee Minho's smirks, and Woo Dohwan's eyebrow twitch and steely gaze). This week's episodes (3-4) have been quite exciting because we are finally getting to the action of the plot that requires the characters to constantly interact with each other (especially Lee Minho's and Kim Goeun's characters because I love the two of them together so much- they have a different dynamic that leaves me hilariously feeling bad for Lee Minho's character). I really can't wait for episodes 5-6 because whew.. for a person who only has four episodes of Lee Minho's incredibly handsome face, it's really not enough. And also, I want to see how the plot unfolds with the first (hopefully not because he has an important piece of information) death of a major/minor character\\xa0;).\\n\\n\",\n",

I just love dramas that get your attention from episode one. That's not the case with this drama. Probably it'll start to get more interesting in the following episodes. The thing is that when I found out that Woo do-hwan was part of the cast I almost fainted you guys he's such a talented actor.

I really missed the fast-paced direction of kim-eun Suk's drama. I am talking about the directing here. As we noticed, DOTS has a fast-paced direction, while Goblin and Mr. Sunshine have more deep and slow-paced direction. In this drama, fast, fun and smooth pacing is combined with deep and dramatic directing elements, which makes this film so beautiful. The angles are beautifully and expressively captured on slow parts at the same time, there are smooth and sharp action on its fast parts.\\nNow let's talk about the story. It was refreshing for me and I was on the edge of my seat watching how the story goes. Honestly, I have so many theories when it comes to time-space bending and multiverse. My mind actually wanders a lot when I see many mathematical equations and amazingly, I can see these in this drama. Mathematical equations being shown here might have a much deeper significance in its plot.\\nThe location of the scar of Lee Gon not making sense might somehow have a much deeper explanation. I am even confused with the time relations, As we can see some characters appearing in a specific time, when it is impossible. The female lead appears to save the young Lee gon from his uncle. But how is it possible? Could it be a foreshadowing of the future events that the female lead might encounter as the drama progresses? My God, help me uncover this.\\n\\n\",\n",

Recall the first episode of the best series you have watched like goblin, scarlet heart, legend of the sea - or any drama is your favorite - and then judge if this drama or any drama is good or not, worthy or not etc\\nLastly, it's Lee Min Ho... he has great series so far with very good rates. I don't think he would be acting in a not profitable production/scenario. My thanks.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nKESFan May 19 2019 9:14 pm \\nAm I the only one kind of disappointed in the lead actress? Kim Go-Eun is an AMAZING actress, but I was hoping that Park Shin Hye would be the leading actress alongside Lee Min Ho. The reason is because Descendants of the Sun, Goblin, and Mr. Sunshine are all connected to each other, and they are also all amazing, so I was hoping for this story to be Park Shin Hye x Lee Min Ho, since they were in The Heirs together.\\nThey would have been a part of the connection between the 3 recent Kim Eun Sook dramas, and Park Shin Hye and Lee Min Ho would have been given a second chance at having a Kim Eun Sook drama that would have actually had quality writing compared to The Heirs. We could have had them love each other in another life, which would have been amazing.\\nThen I was hoping Kim Eun Sook would get the 2 leads from A Gentleman's Dignity and give them a better drama and also connect it to the other 3. I feel like it was a missed opportunity to not give the leading actress role to Park Shin Hye.\\nBut the director did change so I guess those 3 will be independent from the rest of Kim Eun Sook's future dramas unless they collaborate again.\\nStill, I'm just so disappointed that Park Shin Hye wasn't the leading actress and instead Kim Go-Eun.\\nBut maybe this is a one-off deal, and her next story will connect to her previous 3 dramas and add on to that. Maybe Lee Min Ho will get another Kim Eun Sook drama with Park Shin Hye, and maybe it will be of quality content. This drama does sound a bit unrealistic. I know Goblin was unrealistic in its own ways, but it was also realistic in its own ways. This drama just sounds like a fantasy story however, so maybe it is just a one-off.\\n\\n\",\n",

I see it as a redemption that this screenwriter made for having LMH to star in the so generic boring Heirs drama a few years back by offering him this epic piece (i hope it's going to be epic tho!). Honestly speaking i'm a little confused with the plot tho. So in this drama, is LMH going to be playing dual roles (bromance involving dual roles??? that's something new lol) or is the Korean Emperor version of LMH's character would be taking over LMH's present day character carrying out what the other version of his has to do while at the same time taking care of his own business? Seems like i'm gonna have to wait for more updates on this drama. Whoever the leading actress i don't mind but i hope it is not an actress who cannot act all that much and ruins what possibly could affect the best traits of the leading actress, popular actress or not is not even something that really matters as long as it's good.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "[\"I've just finished watching Mr.Sunshine. Although it's the same writer, the feeling is totally different. Mr.Sunshine is so epic and grand but The King Eternal Monarch is the opposite. I feel like watching The Heir Season 2. There are questions that left unanswered in the end.\",\n",

       " 'Done watching it with a smile...',\n",
       " \"Kdrama Addict\\xa0I love the story... I watched Lee Min Ho's series before, he was okey back then. but in TKEM I feel that he matured alot,you can feel the intense emotions from his eyes, facial expression and the tone of his voice.I love Kim Go Eun from Goblin she is an effective actress you can feel her pain, longing, sadness. I think their chemistry is really good. TKEM is not the usual Kdrama. It is worth it... I'll be shipping Kim Go Eun and Lee Min Ho forever they look good together. Congratulations to Kim Eun Sook and the cast of TKEM.\",\n",
       " \"One thing that turned me down about this movie is the plot wasn't as smooth as Goblin when it comes to the love bloom. And also this drama doesn't have epic song. Overall i still enjoy the drama because i'm a huge fan of lee min ho. The most handsome king ever\\xa0???\",\n",

       " \"I've finished the 16th episode. I don't really know what to say. Even if this drema would have huge ratings, I couldnt like it too much. But perhaps it's a bit objective that people got bored with it. I liked the ending, although for some reason couldnt get on with feeling bored. I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on. Is it the dialogues, always the way they talk like riddles. I've lost interest and sometimes couldnt get on what's going on. I'm not sure about any international success it has, but I couldnt enjoy it really much for some reason. I had to watch this, i dont feel like i wasted time. I liked some stories, some things were really emotional. But just not that good. I'd totally prefer Secret Garden over it. It was amazing. Why? I guess screenwriting, directing and all other things really matter and no matter if the story is complex, mysterious or good, without all other elements it doesnt work. I don't think I'll rewatch this.\",\n",
       " \"This drama is the definition of perfection. It reminded me Fringe and amazed me. God bless you Kim Eun Sook for writing this masterpiece. Your dramas are always the best. I must also say that Kim Go Eun's performance is remarkable as usual, you can see everything in her eyes. She is an adorable actress.\",\n",
       " \"So, I'm not sure which fault is that. Plot is actually pretty interesting, and script too. It couldve been one of the best dramas in 2020... But there were something wrong with everything else. I'll list you all things what I believe went wrong.Directing and editing:The drama was very slow, but the pacing is never a problem. I hate comparing, but I cannot avoid to do so with Goblin. It had slow pacing in a lot of moments, but the directing and screenwriting made it all very good, very balanced and harmonic. Same goes to something like CLOY. Soundtrack, OSTs fitted and everything worked perfectly. Fast pacing never makes a series or a drama a better thing as itself, but the directing and editing does. And this flopped here. There were so much of unnecessary things that could be avoided and fast-paced. During the episode 6, which is a pinnacle of boredom in the show, the battle with Japanese ships I cringed and laughed my ass off for all the unnecessary filling and stuff that has been happening there. I were numb when I suddenly bursted out with laughter. They tried to make this so epic with all these camera angles and epic faces of Lee Min Ho and Woo Do Hwan that I laughed so hard I nearly shat my pants. Sorry guys. Same with the scene where cops chasing suspects... in the very same time of episode. It was shown the most boring way it could've been. It didnt work. And there were a lot of these things. Sometimes my interest woke up, but then it disappeared, and then again and again.Characters:The characters were greatly written (not all tho, I still couldnt understand necessarity of Prime Minister and all her scenes in first half of the show) but again, directing made them boring. I were trying to think why and how this show bores me. It just couldnt have made me hooked. The only moments I remember I didnt feel bored was when Eun Sup showed up on screen, when someone died or when Lee Gon went mad on killing everyone. Everything else - sometimes I really had to force myself on looking on screen. I hate to say this, but this ain't good.Chemistry:Between main leads - I dont know. Feelings of Jeong Tae-Eul came out of nowhere really. She cries at some points and it doesnt work for her character and for me, or at least they didnt show how it should've been. And Lee Min Ho - his potential was realised only somewhere near the end of the show, but before I was bored looking at his numb face and idle poses they've been practicing a lot.Storytelling:Its very messy. Why so many unnecessary characters, stories. At some point I've stopped understanding what's going on and had to rethink how certain things are affecting anyone in the series. Oh and there were little accents on moments where there should have been. It was messy as I said earlier. I couldnt remember a lot of names because of that, and lost my interest almost to everyone except main characters (because I was interested what's gonna happen next; I lost my sympathy and enjoyment somewhere in first episodes). The music were just for the background, wasnt fitting in a lot of moments. Sometimes it was so epic I cringed. OSTs were very actually very good tho. When they started to play, I became a bit alive.Every episode, I swear, I was trying to look at from zero, without prejudice. And guess what - I could handle to watch only first few minutes with enjoyment, but the other hour is me being bored but forcing myself to watch because I'm interested in the thing itself and hoping for better episodes.The show has so much of flaws that its gonna take a while to proceed them all. Apparently, this is going to be example that good investment, characters and story can be ruined by poor directing, editing and storytelling. This is going to be example how you shouldn't make a show.People shouldn't suggest that it flopped because of advertisements. If the show was good enough, it wouldnt matter, even tho there were too much of ads and it was too direct that I couldnt help but cringe. But the show itself wasnt as good. I liked it somewhere, enjoyed it a bit. It gave some goosebumps but I just felt something isnt really right. The last like 6-7 episodes were a lot better than first ones, but still sometimes it was boring. And the drama could've been very good, but it turned out this. You should try watch it for yourself, but I dont think I would do it again. I'm kind of tired of it. I'm in the middle of 15th episode and I'm sleepy.\",\n",
       " 'I super duper love this drama! Goosebumps all over my body from the last scene in episode 11, I just cant stop my self leaving a comment here. I swear it’s one of a kind series!!! I love you my Lee❤️❤️❤️',\n",
       " 'I loved this story. It is exceptionally well written, directed and acted. And it would have been perfect, except for the ending. I think it suffers from a problem that is endemic in modern storytelling and betrays a problem in modern thought. It seems that these days it is considered smart to get a college education and settle in a job before you get serious about relationships. To my mind, this story points out the flaw in that way of thinking. As so many stories do, it starts with two people with fully developed lives in different worlds. By that I mean they each has an education, job, family, and relationships they have strived their whole life to make for themselves. This presents a problem for a romantic story, because one of them will ultimately have to give up their world to be with the other. While this story does as brilliant a job as can be done in working with that problem, it is one that is never satisfyingly resolved even to the very last frame. Ultimately we are left feeling that each one puts more value on their job than they do on the person they are supposedly desperate to be with.',\n",

       " 'SPOILERAbout the scar, what a bummer. They made such a big deal out of it then I felt like they dropped the ball on it. Ok, here\\'s some more thoughts ...Yo-Yo Boy (Aka: the spirit of the Manpasikjeok)He is basically the gate keeper and controls access to all the parallel worlds. He has the ability to appear in any physical form (young or older) and moves between worlds at will. Whichever physical form he appears in is probably dependent on what he needs to accomplish.The Yo-Yo I\\'m surprise no one has mentioned the yo-yo and what is its purpose. Here\\'s my 2 cents on this topic. Basically, the yo-yo represents the parallel worlds. You always see the boy constantly moving the yo-yo. This is symbolic of him doing his basic function which is to keep the parallel worlds in perpetual motion and in balance. Think of each of the two discs of the yo-yo as parallel world opposites separated from each other by a string and Yo-Yo boy is there to ensure all worlds are in balance and working the way they should be.When the Manpasikjeok was broken in half, it took some of the control of the worlds out of yo-yo boy\\'s hands and into the hands of whoever has the Manpasikjeok pieces. Lee Lim\\'s activities were basically causing the entire yo-yo to be out of balance. The Corea side of the yo-yo was heavy with activities. If that keeps up, the yo yo will not work right to the point where it will be noticeable. Hence the bleed throughs into both Corea/Korea such as people in both worlds experiencing flashes of their dopplegangers. Ultimately, if nothing is done to correct the imbalance, the yo-yo will actually stop working. This was already well on its way; the more the Corea citizens affect changes in Korea, the longer time freezes. Ultimately, all parallel worlds would come to a stand still at some point (AKA time freezes forever and so is life as we know it).In order to restore balance, Yo-Yo boy needed a force to counter the Lee Lim force that caused the imbalance. This force, however, can not come from the Kingdom of Corea because that is where the driving force that messed things up came from - Lee Lim. The driving force to restore balance must come from the Republic of Korea to balance things out. Just imagine you and I having an arm wrestling contest. If I am winning and I\\'m able to pull your arm past the midpoint toward my side, the only way that balance can be restored is if you exert enough force to bring yourself back to the midpoint. Now apply this same concept to Corea/Korea with me being Corea and you being Korea.A perfect example of why the Corea side can not restore the balance is in Episode 14. When both Lee Lim & the King were inside the place between-zero-and-one at the same time, it made the Manpasikjeok \"whole\" again. They both had an equal chance to change events that night but things still didn\\'t turn out the way they wanted. The 2020 Lee Lim got killed by the 1994 Lee Lim and the King didn\\'t make much of a change to his past situation. Their efforts did not work because the driving force and catalyst to fix both worlds must come from Korea - the other half of the yo-yo.Yo-Yo boy choose Tae-Eul to be that force to provide the equal and opposite reaction to put things in motion and back into balance. Why? Because she is the exact opposite of what Lee Lim stands for, she wants the worlds to be balanced AND she has the courage to pull it off. That was her fate. I think symbolically, she is the red string on the yo-yo. I googled it and this actually exists! \"The Red Thread of Fate is an East Asian belief originating from Chinese mythology. It is commonly thought of as an invisible red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are \"their true love\". ...The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. \"In the last episode, the yo-yo boy & teenage boy were shown as flashbacks in Tae-Eul\\'s life to conveyed that he has been keeping an eye on Tae-Eul all along. If you need more proof of Tae-Eul\\'s fate, rewatch the order of things in the last episode.Her first successful shot went off which represented the force that was needed to get the yo yo going again and the 2 worlds back on track. You know everything is back on track because immediately right after the successful shot:-  The lily plant begins to grow the green shoot.  (Proof that time no longer freezes)- There is now wind in the place between-zero-and-one. You can see the wind because her hair was blowing.- In the King\\'s between-zero-and-one place, all the red balloons and other stuff are now moving in the air.- Lee Lim\\'s body disintegrated in the between-zero-and-one place and his watch that was left was actually working and not frozen in time.- The events that were the result of the 2 worlds crossing disappeared. For example, Sin-Jae\\'s pic from Tae-ul\\'s world.Note that after she fired the successful shot then the King took care of Lee Lim. (At first I thought it was weird the order of things and had to really use my brain cells to figure this one out.)The Fast Romance: diehardfan explains it the best. You have to understand it could be at least 3-4 months by the time they see each other next. So while apart, they are actually not apart because they were thinking of each other and longing to be in the company of each other. This is why the next time they see each other, they keep saying, \"I missed you\", or \"Have you been waiting for me?\" It just solidifies the saying, \"Absence makes the heart grows fonder\".This is really not your typical romance. If you don\\'t know when or if you will ever see the other person again, you will probably do what they do - gladly accept your fate and live in the moment. Cause all you really are guaranteed is just that moment. I think if they put a time caption on when the King meets Tae-Eul next (ex: \"6 months later\") that would help the audience understand their time constraints better.Shin-Jae Jeez, Kim Kyung-Nam is just too cool. His acting was just spot on when his mother ran out to give him a hug…. and he didn\\'t even have to say one word. Bravo!!!Overall, I don\\'t recommend this show for just anyone. If you are a deep thinker and like to solve a good mystery then this is right up your alley. It\\'s really a show that keeps on giving because it does require a lot of utilizing the brain cells to get the full impact of the plot. Even after rewatching things, you start to notice more clues that you didn\\'t really notice before. I love it and hoping there will be a sequel!',\n",

Both actors are amazing, there IS chemistry between the main casts, that's for sure.

At first it seems like out of blue they just fell in love which does not make sense. But actually everytime min ho goes back to his kingdom, it takes time for him to come back and so the time the spent together and the time they are not together somehow made them think of each other more often and made them fall in love for each other. Min ho has to travel back and forth to get to the present because he can only travel one way which at first did not make sense too. But I had to watch it again to understand.

As for the middle section of the series, it picked up and it became cool and interesting, even with the fast-paced relationship that felt like it came out of nowhere (though they're cute, as long as they're out of character).Production was amazing, actors were amazing, especially Woo Do Hwan, Kim Go Eun, and Kim Kyung Nam.Woo Do Hwan nailed his role, it was cool to see him act as if he had 4 characters instead of 2.It was nice to see a different side of Kim Kyung Nam, he was so different on Prison Playbook (which is worth the watch!!)SPOILER!!!!!!!SPOILER!!!!!!!As for the last two episodes, especially the last episode, it was disappointing again. My expectations weren't that high anymore because of the previous events in previous episodes, but the finale was definitely a letdown. For someone who's so desperate to live an eternity, Lee Lim disappointed me. It felt so easy.The script of the whole drama was mostly disappointing, considering how good Mr. Sunshine is overall. There were so many loopholes, and even though you can explain it with assumptions, I feel like it will be better to actually confirm it through the script. It was as if the writer just put whatever she wanted to the story. To be honest, a lot of people finished it for the sake of finishing it as well, giving up on trying to make the story make sense.I mean, you could watch it again or watch it slowly, and make some assumptions for the loopholes, but it's not worth it for me.\",\n",

The chemistry between LMH & KGE is just so cheesy & cringy af that I felt so uncomfortable watching it. They just don't have that spark of chemistry like HB & SYJ from CLOY\",\n",

Just like SC, i invest my time ang emotion to this drama and its worth it.

       " \"I avoided this drama because everywhere I read about it people were complaining about how convoluted or boring it was. Also, I don't hate LMH but I'm always skeptical about his projects because most of the time they're fan-driven rather than story-driven. Worst of all, at the time it was airing The World Of The Married had me by the throat so I had no room for anything else. Last night, I was bored so I decided to throw away one or two hours on this drama to see why everyone hated. And thus commenced the marathon.A day later, I'm done and I have to say it's not as bad as sold. I mean it's not 'Mr. Sunshine' but it's on par with Goblin. It's shine was just dulled by the fact that it was up against a power-house drama. Most of the things people found confusing were just because they were impatient. If you're a person who enjoys mysteries, you'll love seeing the unexplained twists slowly unraveling. As for the claims of lack of chemistry between the leads, it's obviously a rumor made up by people who haven't watched 'Lovely Horribly' . Lee Gon and Tae-Eul's relationship started fast but when it caught on, it was bittersweet and kept on pulling at my heartstrings.I feel like everyone who had a doppelganger gave applause-deserving performances. Jo Young's loyalty was un-parelled no matter the universe. Shin-jae impressed me because he was the one who had the most to lose by doing the right thing, and yet he still did it. The P.M.... lol. Obviously, she's just bad in every single version of herself in the different words.Long story short: I enjoyed it. Try it.\",\n",

       " \"Long story short, this kdrama was a roasted chicken with no seasoning. It's the kind of chicken that you consider a decent meal, but it won't leave you hanging and hoping to eat it again later, nor will you remember it.While I agree with other comments that Lee Min Ho was quite emotionless in this role, the drama on its own failed to bring out any tears or feelings. Although the drama does cover the suffering of many people between the two worlds, their stories always lacked depth and ended up being undeveloped.At the same time, the drama constantly clung onto safety and refused to let anyone important die. As an example (SPOILERS ahead), when both the Royal Guard Captain and his comedian counter-part from the other world got shot and were saved by their bulletproof vests, the writer missed a good opportunity to kill off the comedian counter-part and introduce the consequences of mixing fates of people from two parallel dimensions. That would have resulted in an actual tear jerker this drama needed, and a significant challenge for Lee Gon's and Tae Eul's romance.The only time this drama was close to a tear jerker was when Lee Gon's uncle died, however even that was too sudden and didn't have the impact it should have had, it just happened out of nowhere, but also didn't surprise me.I can't help but compare it to Goblin since the drama has a similar concept and the same female lead actress... Goblin somehow succeeded in making a story that didn't have an obvious plot or ending, whereas Eternal Monarch just stuck with the recycled. Overall this kdrama does not have any re-watch value for me, the romance between the leads was pretty shallow overall.\",\n",

I slept off in episode 1 and 2 but then i realized that the story itself was actually interesting and wanted to find out how it unfolded. It was unfolding really well until they decided to add time travel to it and this left holes in the drama that just does't make sense no matter how you try to explain it. If you have to watch this drama then watch it for woo do hwan cos he slayed his roles.\",\n",
       " 'SPOILERS! I can understand why people are complaining that this flopped after episode 13. The whole time travelling thing became a big problem and that is because it created so much loop holes in the drama. Letting them keep their memory was the biggest loop hole in the drama since it cannot correspond with the past they later created. If the past really changed then he should never have known her hence their memory should not exist. Then there is the problem with lee lim, if he was killed by his past self then the drama has ended because the bad guy is gone but since he still existed that means we followed the one that did the killing, then that would mean there are more lee gon travelling through time since he has never died. Argh! this is so twisted, they should have just made them fall in love with their respective world selves. That would have been a better ending, after all the romance was boring as there was no chemistry.',\n",

About 95% of the questions that pop up are answered by the end.Maybe more could have been done to tell Lee Lim and Lee Gon's personal stories (Lee Gon's character in particular was very bland), as they both seem quite typical hero and villain characters that could have had more of a personal story. But you know when watching that each scene has been planned out a long time in advance, nothing has been added in accidentally, and that really shows in the last episodes of the drama where they tie everything together.The visuals are absolutely insane, just like a hollywood movie, except this is a weekly drama on a free-to-air channel. And all the acting was superb, especially by the supporting characters. The editing of the scenes and feel of the drama reminded me a lot of Goblin as well.All in all, I hadn't expected too much from the drama when I started and yes it was slow in some places, but I found it to still be an enjoyable drama to watch while at home during the pandemic.

I was indeed surprised by his switching of dialects and was really amazed at his portraying of entirely different characters. Even when Jo Yeong disguised as Eun Seop, we could still feel yeong in him. All the characters were well portrayed and the villain was also just amazing.

They should have either recast the role with someone with more distinct features that's easily recognized from Shin-Jae's mother or they need to give both actresses hairdos that are consistently and drastically different from each other so we can recognize them more easily.

I suppose it made a great dramatic scene, but I think it was kinda silly. (I love Maximus though. I love the scene where little LG watching little Maximus from the side with Head Lady Noh). Another scene that I found a little bit annoying is when Luna stabbed JTE.

       " \"I must say, the detailed comments below- for better or worse, made me believe that this drama is going to be one of the best Korean dramas I've ever seen.You can hate it or love it but you can't remain indifferent.It's not for everyone. It has a very complex plot and a lot of twists. It requires concentration and rewatching of the previous episodes. But it has depth and full of emotion.I watched it twice and had long discussions with my BFF about each scene in the released episodes. Best pleasure ever.The actors did great job. For me, the best actor award should be given to Woo Do-Hwan. As a secondary character he has stolen the whole show. I'm so waiting to see him in lead roles.It sucks that the drama didn't get the high ratings it deserves, but like I said - it doesn't suit everyone.For me, this drama received a score of 11 out of 10. Hope the writers will release more series such as Goblin, Descendants of the Sun and The King- Eternal Monarch.\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'Compared to other k-dramas, this would fall on the \"heavy\" side, needing the viewer to give more than the usual attention to the dialogues, and watching the previous episodes is a must, to understand the progression of the story. Yet over-all, I would still rate it as one of the best I have ever seen. LMH is undoubtedly the best among the best of actors, and he carried the drama extremely well from beginning to end. Considering all the restrictions of having to film during the covid outbreak, the staff (director, script writer, etc) still managed to come up with a great project. To all of you, specially LMH, a big kudos and more power. To me, in a scale of 1-10, I would rate this a grand 11. To those who got \"lost\" while watching, I suggest to watch it again, to fully understand the story. Again, congratulations for a job well done. And LMH, you haven\\'t lost anything at all. You have proven once again that you are not just a pretty face, but one of the best actors ever.',\n",

I am a huge fan of Lee Min-Ho but even he is having a hard time saving this drama.

His life already sucks as it is with the uncle business. Being with her is the only thing that makes him happy. Hey producers, can we please give this guy a break in the end? On the other hand, what would you do if you were her? Would you abandon all your prior close relationships to be with him? There is no visiting business. It's an all or nothing. The portal must be closed and they are running against the clock each timesomeone passes over the portal. If it continues, both worlds will perish. Either way, I think it will be a bittersweet ending. Unavoidable....Anyway, the entire cast is really awesome. Oh yeah Yangmi. OMG he is adorable! Can we please give him a heroic scene B4 the show is over?\",\n",
       " \"I do believe the leads have chemistry, a very intense one too, but man the story doesn't help them. It is as if the writer had a beautiful picture of a puzzle in his or her head but put the pieces all wrong and the result is distorted. Some times the plot is very slow, other times it's fine. Either way the drama manages to make you lose interest because of the inconsistency. And it is a pitty because the acting is great and the plot basis is solid. Is it the direction, is it the writing? For me it went south somewhere in there. Also, what the heck is their deal with sponsors? We get it you want to advertise but this is ridiculous. I laughed out so hard when the cafe owner parked her Aston Martin in the middle of the road. I mean I don't watch kdramas for their realism but COME ON!\",\n",

It’s not in-your-face, annoying/cringe-y “cuteness” like many romcoms, but a subtle & sweet chemistry with natural progression. It speaks of the writer's and leads’ abilities that they stuck to the characters and slowly revealed them falling in love, building their chemistry. Way more realistic!\",\n",

But now, after watching it until ep 12. Oh God, This Drama is Amazing.100 Score for Kim eun sook writer. you are amazing. this drama is great, mind blowing, out of the box, or maybe there will be some plot twist? we don’t know yet. But you rock it, you can think it all over that makes us as audience become very curious to what happen next, by watch it per episodes, and you also makes us less confused cause you try to explain every single details. and this drama really amazing cause it brings us to think about the sci-fiction too. a great fantasy drama. the director is also doing a great job, this film hd resolution is best, i like it. the location of the drama is beautiful too. although they are filming during covid-19 situation, they still do the best for this drama. Amazing.For lee min ho, you daebak, 100, amazing, you rock it. this film really has a really strong character on lee min ho. lee min ho do it so welllll. the acting of lee min ho from the start till the end makes me so speechless, he become so great in this drama. we see him really charismatic, he feel it so much, The King.

This drama is litt. they play both of the characters and yess they rock it. great super great. especially the drama can be so cute and funny at the same time, love it from jo young and jo eun seob character. although it’s a bit thrill but they can bring some comedy and romance at the same time. and i think it will be a little bit melo drama too. what will happen with corea and seoul? can’t waittt.But, i wish for the king eternal monarch, to be one of the best drama in 2020 and get a high rating. May the king eternal monarch get much love from audiences.

I don’t think sbs will extended the episodes but could they perhaps extended the duration of the episodes? It’ll be better. I really enjoyed ep 11, I don’t know why it’s the lowest rating.

       " 'Where to start?I was really excited before the show aired, I loved the sneak peeks and trailers. Knowing the cast, the writer and seeing parts of the story made me all hyped up.Then I started watching, if we look solely at the storyline, let’s be honest. It’s a gem, you can do so much with 2 worlds, people who look exactly the same as you, love that expands 2 worlds. But then the story started to unfold, my oh my, I’m dissatisfied. The first episode was perfect, an introduction. From the second episode the writer should’ve started to incorporate little things that would build up to the love arc. The love arc was too forced, which makes it less believable, hence why so many people say that can’t see the chemistry. Because it’s there, but for us viewers chemistry needs to have a foundation. Little things that draw us in and makes us want them to be together.Because there are two worlds, we get introduced to many characters. The ones that live in our world and the people who live in the kingdom, each of them has a story and the drama tries to at least show us how the villain is replacing people. But it’s too much, too many characters and storylines. Which leaves less time to make us get invested in the main cast and their character development. The constant off editing doesn’t make it any better.The drama as a puzzle is ok, I found a lot of easter eggs and I’m watching the show to see the ending unfold.But I would like to take a moment and talk about Woo Do Hwan, what a talent. His acting is off the charts and I can’t get enough of him. The way he makes it totally believable that there are really 2 people with the same face but totally different characters. I’m loving every scene he’s in and he’s the reason i look forward to new episodes. He’s the one carrying the show, at least for me. I hope I haven’t offended anybody. This is my honest review. Please don’t question my intellect, because I get the story and the complicated plots and twists. I just think it’s poorly written and executed.',\n",

The writer has had her hits, but actually this one is a lil bit of a miss. It could have been better had it been directed by another director. Yes to the comment re Goblin director. I personally still love watching it, but I get it why the ratings are not as expected. Each episode doesn’t have its own mini mystery to solve, not enough cliffhanger. It definitely doesn’t have enough oomph for a fantasy drama, almost too vanilla. Though I have to disagree with comments about the lacking main leads chemistry. I think they definitely have good chemistry, but it’s not oozing because of the way their storyline and characters are written. It’s a different kind of romance. I love it cause it feels realistic. A mature relationship between a king and a police officer, no push and pull. And Woo Do Hwan is just adorable in this drama! Would love to see more of Young and Eun Sup with Na Ri and Seung A.

After reading some theories on twitter, I believe that it is Lee Gon’s future self who was kissing Taeeul at the end. He was wearing the same outfit we saw in ep 1: The words he was saying seemed a bit off and was kind of hinting something. Jung taeeul also stepped back when he met lee gon which makes me wonder why. Is it just me but I want Lee Lim to kill more people. Obviously not the main cast but other people because I want to see more action. I do think today’s episode did not flow smoothly. We had to go into about 20 minutes where we left off from ep 9. I think the beginning scenes could of been remove.

And Since the first eps i start to compares this drama with Goblin, ii really loved goblin, the cinematography was superb, both if the drama has superb cinematography, but i just annoyed by the characters of FL on goblin, but i still can feels the romance between the ML and FL on goblin, at least the romance between the two are well developed, not perfect but i can understand and following their developing feelings for each other, and we know from the start the FL is the destined bride for ML. On the other hand, for The King, i can’t, the FL is less annoying than FL on goblin, really KGE characters as police woman on this drama is much way better cause the FL is strong, independent, and smart. But like other people says about the chemistry, the sudden “I Love You” what the f? How come you suddenly loved someone when on the previous eps the FL didn’t show any sparks of being fallin i love to the ML, even when ML kissed the FL, she barely show any feeling of love, come on, if she is a stright forward person why dont you make a better story telling for both of them to develops natural Love story, cause when i saw the scene FL said I Love You, the so many questions that crossed my mind\\xa0: Am i missing some scene? How come she said I Love You with that straight face? Why you started to fall in love to the man who stalks you with no identity and seems crazy (cause he said he is the king from other world), and suddenly you fallen in love? Cause now you know he is the real king from another dimensions? I think what make it feels forces is because as long as I watched every episode both of them are barely talked deeply about each other as a couple, even the ML whose longing to meet FL is need more time to ensure his feeling for her, feels like they don’t know each other deeply to said love to each other, they dont have much time as a couple, they are from different world, so the writer and director should know better that they need a Good Romance story line to intertwined their fate as a couple',\n",

(On ep8 now)-The plot about time and space has always been complicated to execute in any film though some manage to succeed.

       " 'I have a lot to say about this drama. I was really anticipating but I don’t think it has reached to my level of expectations. I’m still enjoying it but it’s not like a WOW drama. The actors are portraying their characters very well. Woo Dohwan, especially, is slaying his dual roles. I can’t believe it’s the same person playing eunseop and joyeong. Sorry but eunseop >>> joyeong. I hope neither of them dies. The cinematography is out of this world, so so beautiful. One of the best cinematography in the kdrama world. The thing I like the most about this drama is the storyline. The storyline is so interesting and hasn’t been done before and I can’t wait to find out more about Lee Lim’s ambition and how Lee Gon will defeat him. Oh, and the theories. There are so many theories and I love reading them. Everyone are like detectives lol. However, there are some aspects about this drama which I wish can improve on. The romance is very bland. Sorry but you have to admit the truth. Even if you’re fans of both of the leads, you can immediately tell that the romance writing is lacking. I personally think there wasn’t enough romance build up between taeeul and lee gon. I’m head over heals with this pair but I understand why viewers are frustrated and confused on how taeeul fell for Lee gon, details were missing. Lee minho and Kim goeun have better chemistry off screen than on screen lol. I still love their romance moments though. One thing for sure that I know everyone is annoyed about is the amount of PPL. I know that every drama there’s PPL but TKEM’s PPL are too obvious. The cringy lines with it is so bad. The production crew can at least try to blend it more well and not make it so obvious. It feels like a commercial drama. Last con, the plot is too slow. There’s only three more weeks left until the drama ends and I don’t even know how they’re going to wrap this up smoothly. The action has only begun now and that’s more than half of the drama. The drama focused way too less on the main objective. Also, there are many secrets being revealed but it also feels like we know nothing at all. They’re saying so much but also nothing at the same time. I hope they don’t cram everything at the end. Nonetheless, I enjoy this drama. It’s my first ongoing kdrama that I’m watching from the very start and I’m always looking forward for the next episodes. I’m on twitter daily, scrolling and reading theories lol. I’m 70% sure it will have a sad ending. The amount of foreshadowing points it out. But you know, sometimes sad endings are meant to be and it’s good to have a cry sometimes. Anyways, I just really hope the ratings will go up soon. I hate how the Korean media always have something bad to say about this drama every week. It’s like someone is purposely trying to drag TKEM down. Please just stop. Looking forward towards the next episode:)',\n",

But you cannot skip a single episode at the beginning because you will not understand the flow of the story. I love the ending of episode 8 and this is the reason why I couldn’t wait for episode 9. There are unnecessary scenes during the first half of this drama. I still do think that they could have done a better storytelling between Gon and Taeul’s affection for each other. But that is just one part of the story. Episode 9, their chemistry is finally showing. You just have to put aside the weird “love story” in the beginning. Now, there is definitely more action. The cinematography of this drama is fantastic! I’m not very fond of their songs, nothing really catchy for me but it worked out for most of the scenes. Everyone is doing a great job putting out their best acts. LMH might appear to be stoic in this drama but his subtle expressions and his overall aura just fits the role of a king. His deep voice can go from flat, to soft to fierce. I love it that his role is intelligent and fierce yet in front of Taeul and the old lady in the palace, he becomes soft. In episode 9, LMH’s acting really stood out. I can now truly, truly say that this is an amazing drama! This show is a good one and probably one of the most interesting dramas I have ever watched. The dark side of this story is what really pulls me. You become so immersed to it because it makes you think. Some people don’t like it but as long as I like it, who cares about opinions. Koreans should be proud that they have talented people who can bring out an awesome project like this one. I think it is underrated and it just doesn’t make sense to me. All the actors in this drama were so on point. I hope they get plenty of rewards. Kudos!',\n",

However the writers seemed to be dragging out the drama on purpose. By the time it reached ep 5 and that weird kiss thing happened, I stopped watching. From the latest comments, it looked as if the female lead’s confession also didn’t make sense to some viewers. I don’t doubt that the leads have huge fan bases, but even in the few eps that I watched, I found the supporting actors more intriguing.

I agree that there are just too many cheesy lines, I am not excited with the love story but more on the mystery of this drama. LMH is just given a script to act on. His acting goes well with him being a king. He is not supposed to act like a clown. He is supposed to be more serious, intelligent and very much well educated. That was the character that he is supposed to play. I agree as well that his character here is a bit bland but I don’t think he is a bad actor. He is not the best actor but to say that he is horrible with his acting is just not right. It’s difficult to compare all their acts in this drama because they are all given different roles to play. I think they all did their parts well. As for the romance, I cannot understand this love story at all. The FL doesn’t seem to show that she fell in love with him. If she did, I cannot find it in any of the episodes that’s already out. I guess I am just not feeling the love story of the lead couple. There’s no building up. It feels like out of nowhere, there comes love that only the actors of the drama, the director and scriptwriter can understand. This is what’s missing from this drama. I don’t blame the actors. I blame it more on how it was written. This parallel world concept may not appeal to many people but for me, it is quite interesting. I love the mystery of this drama and it is quite unique. You will get confused the first time you watch it and that’s why paying attention to each character, each event is very important when you watch this drama. 8 episodes out already and now I can see how it will turn around. It may not have the best ratings but it is not a bad drama. You just need patience and pay attention with their lines, events and people in order for you not to get lost. Don’t be too harsh on the actors of this drama. I am sure they are doing their best to bring out the characters to life. No matter how famous they are, they do get hurt. Your harsh words are like stones being thrown at them and they didn’t do anything bad to you. All they did was to act and bring entertainment.',\n",

Their stories and acting are extremely better than the male lead. The back story of SJ's much more interesting and something to look forward to. WDH's double role is outstanding, he's a show stealer here. The romance isn't there or maybe because the writer thinks that it'll make our heart flutter even before establishing the main lead's loveline, but no at least not for me. The cheesy lines are for fangirls only, nothing more. The confessions of both leads was like reciting an English poem in front of the class, it feels cringey rather than cute. Bromance isn't reaching my liking as well, it's funny that I see bromance between Jo Eun Seob and Jo Yeong more. Watching this only for WDH and KKN.The rating's speak for itself, barely hitting double digits. We're already half of the drama and I think ML is more focused on his obsession with the FL.

First of, The reason why a lot of people find this drama boring, is because there is no endgame in sight, we cant connect with the characters because they’re written in such a dry manner. No one seems to have a personality (the only interesting take at the moment is the body gaurd and his doppelgänger). There is no build up towards a romantic relationship and there’s no real connection between the two main characters. It literally came out of nowhere and didn’t make any sense. The female lead is a spectacular actress, but she’s unemotional throughout and because lee min ho’s character is reserved, it just doesn’t balance each other out. She hasn’t expressed ANY believable feelings for him. They could literally just be friends. They didn’t do anything together to solidify that this was going in a romantic direction and they both ended up being dry. So you can’t feel anything deep between the two. As for the story? Because they want to DRAG this mysterious role that the villain is playing, It ends up making watchers lose interest. They’ve literally been dragging his goal for like 8 episodes straight. We watch and then realize what he’s up to. We can’t feel who these characters are because we haven’t been given any emotions or memories/ flashbacks: encounters to make us feel for them. So we know WHO they are, or how they were before. Besides the body gaurd and the prime minister, everyone else is just bland.',\n",

And the satisfaction it gave to viewers remain. TKEM challenges the IQ and EQ of likers, lurkers, and haters. And that made the story more interesting. Lead cast openly expressed their initial confusion but after reading the entire script they liked the original concept of a fictional parallel world (RK and fictional KC) and the unique dual characters they need to work on 2) The portrayal of actors/actresses varies on the personality/background of the character they are assigned to. Lee Gon is a mathematician (stigma: serious, scientific, assertive, theory based, above all geek, not much of the demonstrative type) before he became the king. LMH is able to muster and deliver the opposing attributes of his character. Jeong Tae-eul is motherless at 5y.o., a street smart kid who decided to become brave that's why she became a detective. She is straightforward, no-nonsense, with issues on showing her femininity or the lady in her. And yes, KGE delivered it well! As for the rest of the cast, a big round of applause to all of them!!! They've been doing great!!! 3) On chemistry of LMH and KGE? we hv subjective / personal biases on this .... but the behind the scenes and interviews expressly and impliedly showed the degree of chemistry they've developed. So it's a thumbs up! 4) for the CGI, i dont have issues on it coz im after the essence of the scene and 5) As for the rating, I am confident the succeeding episodes will draw in attention with heightened mystery, shared loved (70% of LeeGon's mind is.occupied by Jeong Tae-eul), action and unexpected turn of events (wch screenwriter Kim Eun-soo is known for).\",\n",

In this drama, fast, fun and smooth pacing is combined with deep and dramatic directing elements, which makes this film so beautiful. The angles are beautifully and expressively captured on slow parts at the same time, there are smooth and sharp action on its fast parts.Now let's talk about the story. It was refreshing for me and I was on the edge of my seat watching how the story goes. Honestly, I have so many theories when it comes to time-space bending and multiverse. My mind actually wanders a lot when I see many mathematical equations and amazingly, I can see these in this drama. Mathematical equations being shown here might have a much deeper significance in its plot.The location of the scar of Lee Gon not making sense might somehow have a much deeper explanation. I am even confused with the time relations, As we can see some characters appearing in a specific time, when it is impossible. The female lead appears to save the young Lee gon from his uncle. But how is it possible? Could it be a foreshadowing of the future events that the female lead might encounter as the drama progresses? My God, help me uncover this.\",\n",

The reason is because Descendants of the Sun, Goblin, and Mr. Sunshine are all connected to each other, and they are also all amazing, so I was hoping for this story to be Park Shin Hye x Lee Min Ho, since they were in The Heirs together.They would have been a part of the connection between the 3 recent Kim Eun Sook dramas, and Park Shin Hye and Lee Min Ho would have been given a second chance at having a Kim Eun Sook drama that would have actually had quality writing compared to The Heirs. We could have had them love each other in another life, which would have been amazing.Then I was hoping Kim Eun Sook would get the 2 leads from A Gentleman's Dignity and give them a better drama and also connect it to the other 3. I feel like it was a missed opportunity to not give the leading actress role to Park Shin Hye.But the director did change so I guess those 3 will be independent from the rest of Kim Eun Sook's future dramas unless they collaborate again.Still, I'm just so disappointed that Park Shin Hye wasn't the leading actress and instead Kim Go-Eun.But maybe this is a one-off deal, and her next story will connect to her previous 3 dramas and add on to that. Maybe Lee Min Ho will get another Kim Eun Sook drama with Park Shin Hye, and maybe it will be of quality content. This drama does sound a bit unrealistic.

Honestly speaking i'm a little confused with the plot tho. So in this drama, is LMH going to be playing dual roles (bromance involving dual roles??? that's something new lol) or is the Korean Emperor version of LMH's character would be taking over LMH's present day character carrying out what the other version of his has to do while at the same time taking care of his own business? Seems like i'm gonna have to wait for more updates on this drama.

       "'SPOILERAbout the scar, what a bummer. They made such a big deal out of it then I felt like they dropped the ball on it. Ok, here\\'s some more thoughts ...Yo-Yo Boy (Aka: the spirit of the Manpasikjeok)He is basically the gate keeper and controls access to all the parallel worlds. He has the ability to appear in any physical form (young or older) and moves between worlds at will. Whichever physical form he appears in is probably dependent on what he needs to accomplish.The Yo-Yo I\\'m surprise no one has mentioned the yo-yo and what is its purpose. Here\\'s my 2 cents on this topic. Basically, the yo-yo represents the parallel worlds. You always see the boy constantly moving the yo-yo. This is symbolic of him doing his basic function which is to keep the parallel worlds in perpetual motion and in balance. Think of each of the two discs of the yo-yo as parallel world opposites separated from each other by a string and Yo-Yo boy is there to ensure all worlds are in balance and working the way they should be.When the Manpasikjeok was broken in half, it took some of the control of the worlds out of yo-yo boy\\'s hands and into the hands of whoever has the Manpasikjeok pieces. Lee Lim\\'s activities were basically causing the entire yo-yo to be out of balance. The Corea side of the yo-yo was heavy with activities. If that keeps up, the yo yo will not work right to the point where it will be noticeable. Hence the bleed throughs into both Corea/Korea such as people in both worlds experiencing flashes of their dopplegangers. Ultimately, if nothing is done to correct the imbalance, the yo-yo will actually stop working. This was already well on its way; the more the Corea citizens affect changes in Korea, the longer time freezes. Ultimately, all parallel worlds would come to a stand still at some point (AKA time freezes forever and so is life as we know it).In order to restore balance, Yo-Yo boy needed a force to counter the Lee Lim force that caused the imbalance. This force, however, can not come from the Kingdom of Corea because that is where the driving force that messed things up came from - Lee Lim. The driving force to restore balance must come from the Republic of Korea to balance things out. Just imagine you and I having an arm wrestling contest. If I am winning and I\\'m able to pull your arm past the midpoint toward my side, the only way that balance can be restored is if you exert enough force to bring yourself back to the midpoint. Now apply this same concept to Corea/Korea with me being Corea and you being Korea.A perfect example of why the Corea side can not restore the balance is in Episode 14. When both Lee Lim & the King were inside the place between-zero-and-one at the same time, it made the Manpasikjeok \"whole\" again. They both had an equal chance to change events that night but things still didn\\'t turn out the way they wanted. The 2020 Lee Lim got killed by the 1994 Lee Lim and the King didn\\'t make much of a change to his past situation. Their efforts did not work because the driving force and catalyst to fix both worlds must come from Korea - the other half of the yo-yo.Yo-Yo boy choose Tae-Eul to be that force to provide the equal and opposite reaction to put things in motion and back into balance. Why? Because she is the exact opposite of what Lee Lim stands for, she wants the worlds to be balanced AND she has the courage to pull it off. That was her fate. I think symbolically, she is the red string on the yo-yo. I googled it and this actually exists! \"The Red Thread of Fate is an East Asian belief originating from Chinese mythology. It is commonly thought of as an invisible red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are \"their true love\". ...The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. \"In the last episode, the yo-yo boy & teenage boy were shown as flashbacks in Tae-Eul\\'s life to conveyed that he has been keeping an eye on Tae-Eul all along. If you need more proof of Tae-Eul\\'s fate, rewatch the order of things in the last episode.Her first successful shot went off which represented the force that was needed to get the yo yo going again and the 2 worlds back on track. You know everything is back on track because immediately right after the successful shot:-  The lily plant begins to grow the green shoot.  (Proof that time no longer freezes)- There is now wind in the place between-zero-and-one. You can see the wind because her hair was blowing.- In the King\\'s between-zero-and-one place, all the red balloons and other stuff are now moving in the air.- Lee Lim\\'s body disintegrated in the between-zero-and-one place and his watch that was left was actually working and not frozen in time.- The events that were the result of the 2 worlds crossing disappeared. For example, Sin-Jae\\'s pic from Tae-ul\\'s world.Note that after she fired the successful shot then the King took care of Lee Lim. (At first I thought it was weird the order of things and had to really use my brain cells to figure this one out.)The Fast Romance: diehardfan explains it the best. You have to understand it could be at least 3-4 months by the time they see each other next. So while apart, they are actually not apart because they were thinking of each other and longing to be in the company of each other. This is why the next time they see each other, they keep saying, \"I missed you\", or \"Have you been waiting for me?\" It just solidifies the saying, \"Absence makes the heart grows fonder\".This is really not your typical romance. If you don\\'t know when or if you will ever see the other person again, you will probably do what they do - gladly accept your fate and live in the moment. Cause all you really are guaranteed is just that moment. I think if they put a time caption on when the King meets Tae-Eul next (ex: \"6 months later\") that would help the audience understand their time constraints better.Shin-Jae Jeez, Kim Kyung-Nam is just too cool. His acting was just spot on when his mother ran out to give him a hug…. and he didn\\'t even have to say one word. Bravo!!!Overall, I don\\'t recommend this show for just anyone. If you are a deep thinker and like to solve a good mystery then this is right up your alley. It\\'s really a show that keeps on giving because it does require a lot of utilizing the brain cells to get the full impact of the plot. Even after rewatching things, you start to notice more clues that you didn\\'t really notice before. I love it and hoping there will be a sequel!'"

      "Okay...overall I think this drama was good. Their love story was cute. But am I the only one who found it confusing AF...???? I constantly had questions throughout the show. Way too many characters to keep track of. The ending wasn't bad.. but could have been better.(***SPOILER ahead***) It made me kind of sad that Sin Jae didn't know who they were...and Eun Sup didn't end up knowing who Lee Gon was?? like why? and Lee Gon and Tae Eul just went back and forth from one world to another for the rest of their lives?? Couldn't they at least get married or something? Like doesn't her dad question where she's going every weekend? Idk it just wasn't satisfying. Also, where did the teen version of the yoyo kid come from??? Some things just did not make sense! :?\n",

I can't imagine the writer trying to explain the parallel universe using (Heisenberg uncertainty principle and wave particle paradox)....... It kind of seems absurd and the plot of the drama was just too lame.\n",

I'm also very confused about the boy with the yoyo. I get he was the magic stick thing but the teen boy came out of nowhere!!\n"
